<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h5>RIGOLETTE'S FIRST SORROW.</h5>


<p>Rigolette's apartment was still in all its extreme
nicety; the large silver watch placed over the mantelpiece,
in a small boxwood stand, denoted the hour of
four. The severe cold weather having ceased, the thrifty
little needlewoman had not lighted her stove.</p>

<p>From the window, a corner of blue sky was scarcely
perceptible over the masses of irregularly built roofs,
garrets, and tall chimneys, which bounded the horizon
on the other side of the street. Suddenly a sunbeam,
which, as it were, wandered for a moment between two
high gables, came for an instant to purple with its
bright rays the windows of the young girl's chamber.</p>

<p>Rigolette was at work, seated by her window; and the
soft shadow of her charming profile stood out from
the transparent light of the glass as a cameo of rosy
whiteness on a silver ground. Brilliant hues played on
her jet black hair, twisted in a knot at the back of her
head, and shaded with a warm amber colour the ivory
of her industrious little fingers, which plied the needle
with incomparable activity. The long folds of her brown
gown, confined at the waist by the bands of her green
apron, half concealed her straw-seated chair, and her
pretty feet rested on the edge of a stool before her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Like a rich lord, who sometimes amuses himself in
hiding the walls of a cottage beneath splendid hangings,
the setting sun for a moment lighted up this little
chamber with a thousand dazzling fires, throwing his
golden tints on the curtains of gray and green stuff,
and making the walnut-tree furniture glisten with brightness,
and the dry-rubbed floor look like heated copper;
whilst it encircled in a wire-work of gold the grisette's
bird-cage. But, alas! in spite of the exciting splendour
of this sun-ray, the two canaries (male and female)
flitted about uneasily, and, contrary to their usual habit,
did not sing a note. This was because, contrary to her
usual habit, Rigolette did not sing. The three never
warbled without one another; almost invariably the
cheerful and matin song of the latter called forth that
of the birds, who, more lazy, did not leave their nests as
early as their mistress. Then there were rivalries,&mdash;contentions
of clear, sonorous, pearly, silvery notes, in
which the birds had not always the advantage.</p>

<p>Rigolette did not sing, because, for the first time in
her life, she experienced a sorrow. Up to this time, the
sight of the misery of the Morels had often affected her;
but such sights are too familiar to the poorer classes to
cause them any very lasting melancholy. After having,
almost every day, succoured these unfortunates as far as
was in her power, sincerely wept with and for them, the
young girl felt herself at the same time moved and satisfied,&mdash;moved
by their misfortunes, and satisfied at having
shown herself pitiful. But this was not a sorrow.
Rigolette's natural gaiety soon regained its empire; and
then, without egotism, but by a simple fact of comparison,
she found herself so happy in her little chamber,
after leaving the horrible den of the Morels, that her
momentary sadness speedily disappeared.</p>

<p>This lightness of impression was so little affected by
personal feeling, that, by a mode of extremely delicate
reasoning, the grisette considered it almost a duty to aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
those more unhappy than herself, that she might thus
unscrupulously enjoy an existence so very precarious and
entirely dependent on her labour, but which, compared
with the fearful distress of the lapidary's family, appeared
to her almost luxurious.</p>

<p>"In order to sing without compunction, when we have
near us persons so much to be pitied," she said, naïvely,
"we must have been as charitable to them as possible."</p>

<p>Before we inform our reader the cause of Rigolette's
first sorrow, we are desirous to assure him, or her, completely
as to the virtue of this young girl. We are sorry
to use the word virtue,&mdash;a serious, pompous, solemn
word, which almost always brings with it ideas of painful
sacrifice, of painful struggle against the passions, of
austere meditations on the final close of all things here
below. Such was not the virtue of Rigolette. She had
neither deeply struggled nor meditated; she had worked,
and laughed, and sung. Her prudence, as she called it,
when speaking frankly and sincerely to Rodolph, was
with her a question of time,&mdash;she had not the leisure
to be in love. Particularly lively, industrious, and
orderly, order, work, and gaiety had often, unknown
to herself, defended, sustained, saved her.</p>

<p>It may be deemed, perchance, that this morality is
light, frivolous, casual; but of what consequence is the
cause, so that the effect endures? Of what consequence
are the directions of the roots of a plant, provided the
flower blooms pure, expanded, and full of perfume?</p>

<p>Apropos of our utopianisms, as to the encouragement,
help, and recompenses which society ought to grant to
artisans remarkable for their eminent social qualities,
we have alluded to that protection of virtue (one of the
projects of the Emperor, by the way). Let us suppose
this admirable idea realised. One of the real philanthropists
whom the Emperor proposed to employ in
searching after worth has discovered Rigolette. Abandoned
without advice, without aid, exposed to all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
perils of poverty, to all the seductions with which
youth and beauty are surrounded, this charming girl
has remained pure; her honest, hard-working life might
serve for a model and example. Would not this young
creature deserve, not a mere recompense, not succour
only, but some impressive words of approbation and
encouragement, which would give her a consciousness
of her own worth, exalt her in her own eyes, and lay on
her obligations for the future? At least she would
know that she was followed by eyes full of solicitude
and protection in the difficult path in which she is
progressing with so much courage and serenity; she
would know that, if one day the want of work or sickness
threatened to destroy the equilibrium of the poor
and occupied life, which depends solely on work and
health, a slight help, due to her former deserts, would
be given to her.</p>

<p>People, no doubt, will exclaim against the impossibility
of this tutelary surveillance, which would surround persons
particularly worthy of interest through their previous
excellent lives. It seems to us that society has
already resolved this problem. Has it not already imagined
the superintendence of the police, for life or for a
period, for the most useful purpose of constantly controlling
the conduct of dangerous persons, noted for the
infamy of their former lives? Why does not society
exercise also a superintendence of moral charity?</p>

<p>But let us leave the lofty stilts of our utopianisms, and
return to the cause of Rigolette's first sorrow.</p>

<p>With the exception of Germain, a well-behaved, open-hearted
young man, the grisette's neighbours had all, at
first, begun on terms of familiarity, believing her offers
of good neighbourship were little flirtations; but these
gentlemen had been compelled to admit, with as much
astonishment as annoyance, that they found in Rigolette
an amiable and mirthful companion for their Sunday
excursions, a pleasant neighbour, and a kind-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
creature, but not a mistress. Their surprise and their
annoyance, at first very great, gradually gave way before
the frank and even temper of the grisette; and then, as
she had sagaciously said to Rodolph, her neighbours
were proud on Sundays to have on their arms a pretty
girl, who was an honour to them in every way (Rigolette
was quite regardless of appearances), and who only
cost them the share of the moderate pleasures, whose
value was doubled by her presence and nice appearance.
Besides, the dear girl was so easily contented! In her
days of penury she dined well and gaily off a morsel of
warm cake, which she nibbled with all the might of her
little white teeth; after which, she amused herself so
much with a walk on the boulevards or in the arcades.</p>

<p>If our readers feel but little sympathy with Rigolette,
they will at least confess that a person must be very
absurd, or very cruel, to refuse once a week these simple
amusements to so delightful a creature, who, besides
having no right to be jealous, never prevented her cavaliers
from consoling themselves for her cruelty by
flirtations with other damsels.</p>

<p>François Germain alone never founded any vain hopes
on the familiarity of the young girl, but, either from
instinct of heart or delicacy of mind, he guessed from
the first day how very agreeable the singular companionship
of Rigolette might be made.</p>

<p>What might be imagined happened, and Germain fell
passionately in love with his neighbour, without daring
to say a word to her of his love.</p>

<p>Far from imitating his predecessors, who, convinced
of the vanity of their pursuit, had consoled themselves
with other loves, without being on that account the less
on good terms with their neighbour, Germain had most
supremely enjoyed his intimacy with the young girl,
passing with her not only his Sunday but every evening
when he was not engaged. During these long hours
Rigolette was, as usual, merry and laughing; Germain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
tender, attentive, serious, and often somewhat sad. This
sadness was his only drawback, for his manners, naturally
good, were not to be compared with the foppery
of M. Girandeau, the commercial traveller, alias bagman,
or with the noisy eccentricities of Cabrion; but M.
Girandeau by his unending loquacity, and the painter
by his equally interminable fun, took the lead of Germain,
whose quiet composure rather astonished his little
neighbour, the grisette.</p>

<p>Rigolette then had not, as yet, testified any decided
preference for any one of her beaux; but as she was
by no means deficient in judgment, she soon discovered
that Germain alone united all the qualities requisite for
making a reasonable woman happy.</p>

<p>Having stated all these facts, we will inquire why
Rigolette was sad, and why neither she nor her birds
sang. Her oval and fresh-looking face was rather pale;
her large black eyes, usually gay and brilliant, were
slightly dulled and veiled; whilst her whole look bespoke
unusual fatigue. She had been working nearly all the
night; from time to time she looked sorrowfully at a
letter which lay open on a table near her. This letter
had been addressed to her by Germain, and contained as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigs">"<span class="smcap">Prison of the Conciergerie</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Mademoiselle</span>:&mdash;The place from which I address you will
sufficiently prove to you the extent of my misfortune,&mdash;I am
locked up as a robber. I am guilty in the eyes of all the world,
and yet I am bold enough to write to you! It is because it
would, indeed, be dreadful to me to believe that you consider me
as a degraded criminal. I beseech you not to condemn me until
you have perused this letter. If you discard me, that will be the
final blow, and will indeed overwhelm me. I will tell you all that
has passed. For some time I had left the Rue du Temple, but
I knew through poor Louise that the Morel family, in whom you
and I took such deep interest, were daily more and more wretched.
Alas, my pity for these poor people has been my destruction!
I do not repent it, but my fate is very cruel. Last night I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
stayed very late at M. Ferrand's, occupied with business of
importance. In the room in which I was at work was a bureau,
in which my employer shut up every day the work I had done.
This evening he appeared much disturbed and troubled, and said
to me, 'Do not leave until these accounts are finished, and then
put them in the bureau, the key of which I will leave with you;'
and then he left the room. When my work was done I opened
the drawer to put it away, when, mechanically, my eyes were
attracted by an open letter, on which I read the name of Jérome
Morel, the lapidary. I confess that, seeing that it referred to
this unfortunate man, I had the indiscretion to read this letter;
and I learnt that the artisan was to be arrested next day on an
overdue bill of thirteen hundred francs, at the suit of M. Ferrand,
who, under an assumed name, had imprisoned him. This information
was from an agent employed by M. Ferrand. I knew
enough of the situation of the Morel family to be aware of the
terrible blow which the imprisonment of their only support must
inflict upon them, and I was equally distressed and indignant.
Unfortunately I saw in the same drawer an open box, with two
thousand francs in gold in it. At this moment I heard Louise
coming up the stairs, and without reflecting on the seriousness of
my offence, but profiting by the opportunity which chance offered,
I took thirteen hundred francs, went to her in the passage, and
put the money in her hand, saying, 'They are going to arrest
your father to-morrow at daybreak, for thirteen hundred francs,&mdash;here
they are. Save him, but do not say that the money comes
from me. M. Ferrand is a bad man.' You see, mademoiselle, my
intention was good, but my conduct culpable. I conceal nothing
from you, but this is my excuse. By dint of saving for a long
time I had realised, and placed with a banker, the sum of fifteen
hundred francs, but the cashier of the banker never came to the
office before noon. Morel was to be arrested at daybreak, and
therefore it was necessary that she should have the money so as
to pay it in good time; if not, even if I could have gone in the
day to release him from prison, still he would be arrested and
carried off in presence of his wife, whom such a blow must
have killed. Besides, the heavy costs of the writ would have
been added to the expenses of the lapidary. You will understand,
I dare say, that all these new misfortunes would not have
befallen me if I had been able to restore the thirteen hundred
francs I had taken back again to the bureau before M. Ferrand
discovered anything; unfortunately, I fell into that mistake. I
left M. Ferrand's, and was no longer under the impression of
indignation and pity which had impelled me to the step. I began
to reflect upon all the dangers of my position. A thousand fears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
then came to assail me. I knew the notary's severity, and he
might come after I left and search in his bureau and discover
the theft; for in his eyes&mdash;in the eyes of the world&mdash;it is a
theft. These thoughts overwhelmed me, and, late as it was,
I ran to the banker's to supplicate him to give me my money
instantly. I should have found an excuse for this urgent request,
and then I should have returned to M. Ferrand and replaced the
money I had taken. By an unlucky chance, the banker had gone
to Belleville for two days, to his country-house, where he was
engaged in some plantations. Everything seemed to conspire
against me. I waited for daybreak with intense anxiety, and
hastened to Belleville,&mdash;the banker had just left for Paris. I
returned, saw him, obtained my money, hastened to M. Ferrand;
everything was discovered. But this is only a portion of
my misfortunes. The notary at once accused me of having
robbed him of fifteen thousand francs in bank-notes, which, he
declared, were in the drawer of the bureau, with the two thousand
francs in gold. This was a base accusation,&mdash;an infamous lie!
I confess myself guilty of the first abstraction, but, by all that is
most sacred in the world, I swear to you, mademoiselle, that I am
innocent of the second. I never saw a bank-note in the drawer.
There were only two thousand francs in gold, from which I took
the thirteen hundred francs I have mentioned. This is the truth,
mademoiselle. I am under this terrible accusation, and yet I
affirm that you ought to know me incapable of a lie. But will
you,&mdash;do you believe me? Alas, as M. Ferrand said, 'he who
has taken a small sum may equally have taken a large amount,
and his word does not deserve belief.' I have always seen you so
good and devoted to the unhappy, mademoiselle, and I know you
are so frank and liberal-minded, that your heart will guide you in
the just appreciation of the truth, I hope. I do not ask any more.
Give credit to my words, and you will find in me as much to pity
as to blame; for, I repeat to you, my intention was good, and
circumstances impossible to foresee have destroyed me. Oh,
Mlle. Rigolette, I am very unhappy! If you knew in the midst
of what a set of persons I am doomed to exist until my trial is
over! Yesterday they took me to a place which they call the
dépôt of the prefecture of police. I cannot tell you what I felt
when, after having gone up a dark staircase, I reached a door with
an iron wicket, which was opened and soon closed upon me. I
was so troubled in my mind that I could not, at first, distinguish
anything. A hot and fetid air came upon me, and I heard a loud
noise of voices mingled with sinister laughs, angry exclamations,
and depraved songs. I remained motionless at the door for
awhile, looking at the stone flooring of the apartment, and neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
daring to advance nor lift up my eyes, thinking that everybody
was looking at me. They were not, however, thinking of me; for
a prisoner more or less does not at all disturb these men. At last I
ventured to look up, and, oh, what horrid countenances! What
ragged wretches! What dirty and bespattered garments! All
the exterior marks of misery and vice! There were forty or fifty
seated, standing, or lying on benches secured to the wall,&mdash;vagrants,
robbers, assassins, and all who had been apprehended
during the night and day. When they perceived me I found
a sad consolation in seeing that they did not recognise me as
belonging or known to them. Some of them looked at me with
an insulting and derisive air, and then began to talk amongst
themselves in a low tone, and in some horrible jargon, not one
word of which did I understand. After a short time one of the
most brutal amongst them came, and, slapping me on the shoulder,
asked me for money to pay my footing. I gave them some
silver, hoping thus to purchase repose; but it was not enough, and
they demanded more, which I refused. Then several of them surrounded
me and assailed me with threats and imprecations, and
were proceeding to extremities, when, fortunately for me, a turnkey
entered, who had been attracted by the noise. I complained
to him, and he insisted on their restoring to me the money I had
given them already, adding that, if I liked to pay a small fee,
I should go to what is called the pistole; that is, be in a cell to
myself. I accepted the offer gratefully, and left these ruffians in
the midst of their loud menaces for the future; 'for,' said they,
'we are sure to meet again, when I could not get away from
them.' The turnkey conducted me to a cell, where I passed the
rest of the night. It is from here that I now write to you, Mlle.
Rigolette. Directly after my examination I shall be taken to
another prison, called La Force, where I expect to meet many
of my companions in the station-house. The turnkey, interested
by my grief and tears, has promised me to forward this letter to
you, although such kindnesses are strictly forbidden. I ask,
Mlle. Rigolette, a last service of your friendship, if, indeed, you
do not blush now for such an intimacy. In case you will kindly
grant my request, it is this: With this letter you will receive
a small key, and a line for the porter of the house I live in, Boulevard
St. Denis, No. 11. I inform him that you will act as if it
were myself with respect to everything that belongs to me, and
that he is to attend to your instructions. He will take you to
my room, and you will have the goodness to open my <i>secrétaire</i>
with the key I send you herewith. In this you will find a large
packet containing different papers, which I beg of you to take
care of for me. One of them was intended for you, as you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
see by the address; others have been written of you, in happier
days. Do not be angry. I did not think they would ever come
to your knowledge. I beg you, also, to take the small sum of
money which is in this drawer, as well as a satin bag, which contains
a small orange silk handkerchief, which you wore when we
used to go out on Sundays, and which you gave me on the day
I quitted the Rue du Temple. I should wish that, excepting a
little linen which you will be so good as send to me at La
Force, you would sell the furniture and things I possess; for,
whether acquitted or found guilty, I must of necessity be obliged
to quit Paris. Where shall I go? What are my resources? God
only knows. Madame Bouvard, the saleswoman of the Temple,
who has already sold and bought for me many things, will perhaps
take all the furniture, etc., at once. She is a very fair-dealing
woman, and this would save you a great deal of trouble,
for I know how precious your time is. I have paid my rent in
advance, and I have, therefore, only to ask you to give a small
present to the porter. Excuse, mademoiselle, the trouble of these
details; but you are the only person in the world to whom I dare
and can address myself. I might, perhaps, have asked one of M.
Ferrand's clerks to do this service for me, as we were on friendly
terms, but I feared his curiosity as to certain papers. Several
concern you, as I have said, and others relate to the sad events
in my life. Ah, believe me, Mlle. Rigolette, if you grant me
this last favour, this last proof of former regard, it will be my
only consolation under the great affliction in which I am plunged;
and, in spite of all, I hope you will not refuse me. I also beg of
you to give me permission to write to you sometimes. It will be
so consoling, so comforting to me, to be able to pour out my heavy
sorrows into a kind heart. Alas, I am alone in the world,&mdash;no
one takes the slightest interest in me! This isolation was
before most painful to me. Think what it must be now! And
yet I am honest, and have the consciousness of never having
injured any one, and of always having, at the peril of my life,
testified my aversion for what is wicked and wrong; as you will
see by the papers, which I pray of you to take care of, and which
you may read. But when I say this, who will believe me? M.
Ferrand is respected by all the world; his reputation for probity
is long established; he has a just cause of accusation against me,
and he will crush me. I resign myself at once to my fate. Now,
Mlle. Rigolette, if you do believe me, you will not, I hope, feel
any contempt for me, but pity me; and you will, perhaps, carry
your generosity so far as to come one day,&mdash;some Sunday (alas,
what recollections that word brings up!)&mdash;some Sunday, to see
me in the reception-room of my prison. But no, no; I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
could dare to see you in such a place! Yet you are so good, so
kind, that&mdash;if&mdash;I am compelled to break off this letter and
send it to you at once, with the key, and a line for the porter,
which I write in great haste. The turnkey has come to tell me
that I am going directly before the magistrate. Adieu, adieu,
Mlle. Rigolette! Do not discard me, for my hope is in you, and
in you only!</p>

<p class="sigs">"<span class="smcap">François Germain</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">"P. S.&mdash;If you reply, address your letter to me at the prison
of La Force."</p>
</div>

<p>We may now divine the cause of Rigolette's first
sorrow.</p>

<p>Her excellent heart was deeply wounded at a misfortune
of which she had no suspicion until that
moment. She believed unhesitatingly in the entire
veracity of the statement of Germain, the unfortunate
son of the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Not very strait-laced, she thought her old neighbour
exaggerated his fault immensely. To save the unhappy
father of a family, he had momentarily appropriated a
sum which he thought he could instantly refund. This
action, in the grisette's eyes, was but generous.</p>

<p>By one of those contradictions common to women,
and especially to women of her class, this young girl,
who until then had not felt for Germain more than her
other neighbours, but a kind and mirthful friendship,
now experienced for him a decided preference. As soon
as she knew that he was unfortunate, unjustly accused,
and a prisoner, his remembrance effaced that of all his
former rivals. Yet Rigolette did not all at once feel
intense love, but a warm and sincere affection, full of
pity and determined devotion,&mdash;a sentiment which was
the more new with her in consequence of the better
sensations it brought with it.</p>

<p>Such was the moral position of Rigolette when
Rodolph entered her chamber, having first rapped
very discreetly at the door.</p>

<p>"Good morning, neighbour," said Rodolph to Rigolette;
"do not let me disturb you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not at all, neighbour. On the contrary, I am delighted
to see you, for I have had something to vex me
dreadfully."</p>

<p>"Why, in truth, you look very pale, and appear as
though you had been weeping."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have been weeping, and for a good reason.
Poor Germain! There&mdash;read!" And Rigolette handed
the letter of the prisoner to Rodolph. "Is not that
enough to break one's heart? You told me you took an
interest in him,&mdash;now's the time to prove it!" she
added, whilst Rodolph was attentively reading the
letter. "Is that wicked old M. Ferrand at war with
all the world? First he attacked that poor Louise, and
now he assails Germain. Oh, I am not ill-natured; but
if some great harm happened to this notary, I should
really be glad! To accuse such an honest young man
of having stolen fifteen thousand francs from him!
Germain, too! He who was honesty itself! And
such a steady, serious young man; and so sad, too!
Oh, he is indeed to be pitied, in the midst of all these
wretches in his prison! Ah, M. Rodolph, from to-day
I begin to see that life is not all <i>couleur-de-rose</i>."</p>

<p>"And what do you propose to do, my little neighbour?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean to do? Why, of course, all that
Germain asks of me, and as quickly as possible. I
should have been gone before now, but for this work,
which is required in great haste, and which I must take
instantly to the Rue St. Honoré, on my way to Germain's
room, where I am going to get the papers he
speaks of. I have passed part of the night at work,
that I might be forward. I shall have so many things
to do besides my usual work that I must be excessively
methodical. In the first place, Madame Morel is very
anxious that I should see Louise in prison. That will
be a hard task, but I shall try to do it. Unfortunately,
I do not know to whom I should address myself."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had thought of that."</p>

<p>"You, neighbour?"</p>

<p>"Here is an order."</p>

<p>"How fortunate! Can't you procure me also an
order for the prison of poor, unhappy Germain? He
would be so delighted!"</p>

<p>"I will also find you the means of seeing Germain."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, M. Rodolph."</p>

<p>"You will not be afraid, then, of going to his prison?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; although my heart will beat very
violently the first time. But that's nothing. When
Germain was free, was he not always ready to anticipate
all my wishes, and take me to the theatre, for a walk,
or read to me of an evening? Well, and now he is in
trouble, it is my turn. A poor little mouse like me cannot
do much, I know that well enough; but all I can do
I will do, that he may rely upon. He shall find that
I am a sincere friend. But, M. Rodolph, there is one
thing which pains me, and that is that he should doubt
me,&mdash;that he should suppose me capable of despising
him! I!&mdash;and for what, I should like to know? That
old notary accuses him of robbery. I know it is not
true. Germain's letter has proved to me that he is
innocent, even if I had thought him guilty. You have
only to see him, and you would feel certain that he is
incapable of a bad action. A person must be as wicked
as M. Ferrand to assert such atrocious falsehoods."</p>

<p>"Bravo, neighbour; I like your indignation."</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish I were a man, that I might go to
this notary and say to him, 'Oh, you say that Germain
has robbed you, do you? Well, then, that's for you!
And that he cannot steal from you, at all events?'
And thump&mdash;thump&mdash;thump, I would beat him till
I couldn't stand over him."</p>

<p>"You administer justice very expeditiously," said
Rodolph, smiling.</p>

<p>"Because it makes my blood boil. And, as Germain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
says in his letter, all the world will side with his employer,
because he is rich and looked up to, whilst
Germain is poor and unprotected, unless you will come
to his assistance, M. Rodolph,&mdash;you who know such
benevolent persons. Do not you think that something
could be done?"</p>

<p>"He must await his sentence. Once acquitted, as I
believe he will be, he will not want for proofs of the
interest taken in him. But listen, neighbour; for I
know I may rely on your discretion."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, M. Rodolph, I never blab."</p>

<p>"Well, then, no one must know&mdash;not even Germain
himself&mdash;that he has friends who are watching over
him,&mdash;for he has friends."</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"Very powerful and devoted."</p>

<p>"It would give him much courage to know that."</p>

<p>"Unquestionably; but perhaps he might not keep it
to himself. Then M. Ferrand, alarmed, would be on his
guard,&mdash;his suspicions would be aroused; and, as he is
very cunning, it would become very difficult to catch
him, which would be most annoying; for not only must
Germain's innocence be made clear, but his denouncer
must be unmasked."</p>

<p>"I understand, M. Rodolph."</p>

<p>"It is the same with Louise; and I bring you this
order to see her, that you may beg of her not to tell any
person what she disclosed to me. She will know what
that means."</p>

<p>"I understand, M. Rodolph."</p>

<p>"In a word, let Louise beware of complaining in
prison of her master's wickedness. This is most
important. But she must conceal nothing from the
barrister who will come from me to talk with her as to
the grounds of her defence. Be sure you tell her all this."</p>

<p>"Make yourself easy, neighbour, I will forget nothing;
I have an excellent memory. But, when we talk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
goodness, it is you who are so good and kind. If any
one is in trouble, then you come directly."</p>

<p>"I have told you, my good little neighbour, that I am
but a poor clerk; but when I meet with good persons
who deserve protection, I instantly tell a benevolent
individual who has entire confidence in me, and they
are helped at once. That's all I do in the matter."</p>

<p>"And where are you lodging, now you have given up
your chamber to the Morels?"</p>

<p>"I live in a furnished lodging."</p>

<p>"Oh, how I should hate that! To be where all the
world has been before you, it is as if everybody had
been in your place."</p>

<p>"I am only there at nights, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand,&mdash;it is less disagreeable. Yet I
shouldn't like it, M. Rodolph. My home made me so
happy, I had got into such a quiet way of living, that I
did not think it was possible I should ever know a
sorrow. And yet, you see&mdash;But no, I cannot describe
to you the blow which Germain's misfortune has brought
upon me. I have seen the Morels, and others beside,
who were very much to be pitied certainly. But, at
best, misery is misery; and amongst poor folk, who look
for it, it does not surprise them, and they help one
another as well as they can. To-day it is one, to-morrow
it is another. As for oneself, what with courage and
good spirit, one extricates oneself. But to see a poor
young man, honest and good, who has been your friend
for a long time,&mdash;to see him accused of robbery, and
imprisoned and huddled up with criminals!&mdash;ah, really,
M. Rodolph, I cannot get over that; it is a misfortune I
had never thought of, and it quite upsets me."</p>

<p>"Courage, courage! Your spirits will return when
your friend is acquitted."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he must be acquitted. The judges have
only to read his letter to me, and that would be enough,&mdash;would
it not, M. Rodolph?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, this letter has all the appearance of truth.
You must let me have a copy of it, for it will be necessary
for Germain's defence."</p>

<p>"Certainly, M. Rodolph. If I did not write such a
scrawl, in spite of the lessons which good Germain gave
me, I would offer to copy it myself; but my writing is
so large, so crooked, and has so many, many faults."</p>

<p>"I will only ask you to trust the letter with me until
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"There it is; but you will take great care of it, I
hope. I have burnt all the notes which M. Cabrion and
M. Girandeau wrote me in the beginning of our acquaintance,
with flaming hearts and doves at the top of the
paper, when they thought I was to be caught by their
tricks and cajoleries; but this poor letter of Germain's I
will keep carefully, as well as the others, if he writes me
any more; for they, you know, M. Rodolph, will show
in my favour that he has asked these small services,&mdash;won't
they, M. Rodolph?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly; and they will prove that you are
the best little friend any one can desire. But, now I
think of it, instead of going alone to Germain's room,
shall I accompany you?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure, neighbour. The night is coming on,
and, in the evening, I do not like to be alone in the
streets; besides that, I have my work to carry nearly as
far as the Palais Royal. But perhaps it will fatigue
and annoy you to go so far?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. We will have a coach."</p>

<p>"Really! Oh, how pleased I should be to go in a
coach if I had not so much to make me melancholy!
And I really must be melancholy, for this is the first
day since I have been here that I have not sung during
the day. My birds are really quite astonished. Poor
little dears! They cannot make it out. Two or three
times Papa Crétu has piped a little to try me; I endeavoured
to answer him, but, after a minute or two, I began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
to cry. Ramonette then began; but I could not answer
one any better than the other."</p>

<p>"What singular names you have given your birds:
Papa Crétu and Ramonette!"</p>

<p>"Why, M. Rodolph, my birds are the joy of my
solitude,&mdash;my best friends; and I have given them the
names of the worthy couple who were the joy of my
childhood, and were also my best friends, not forgetting
that, to complete the resemblance, Papa Crétu and
Ramonette were gay, and sang like birds."</p>

<p>"Ah, now, yes, I remember, your adopted parents were
called so."</p>

<p>"Yes, neighbour, they are ridiculous names for birds,
I know; but that concerns no one but myself. And
besides, it was in this very point that Germain showed
his good heart."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Why, M. Girandeau and M. Cabrion&mdash;especially M.
Cabrion&mdash;were always making their jokes on the names
of my birds. To call a canary Papa Crétu! There
never was such nonsense as M. Cabrion made of it, and
his jests were endless. If it was a cock bird, he said,
'Why, that would be well enough to call him Crétu. As
to Ramonette, that's well enough for a hen canary, for
it resembles Ramona.' In fact, he quite wore my
patience out, and for two Sundays I would not go
out with him in order to teach him a lesson; and I
told him very seriously, that if he began his tricks,
which annoyed me so much, we should never go out
together again."</p>

<p>"What a bold resolve!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was really a sacrifice on my part, M. Rodolph,
for I was always looking forward with delight to
my Sundays, and I was very much tried by being kept
in all alone in such beautiful weather. But that's nothing.
I preferred sacrificing my Sundays to hearing M.
Cabrion continue to make ridicule of those whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
I respected. Certainly, after that, but for the idea I
attached to them, I should have preferred giving my
birds other names; and, you must know, there is one
name which I adore,&mdash;it is Colibri.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I did not change,
because I never will call those birds by any other name
than Crétu and Ramonette; if I did, I should seem to
make a sacrifice, that I forgot my good, adopted parents,&mdash;don't
you think so, M. Rodolph?"</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Colibri is a celebrated chanson of Béranger, the especial poet of grisettes.&mdash;<i>English
Translator</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"You are right a thousand times over. And Germain
did not turn these names into a jest, eh?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, the first time he heard them he
thought them droll, like every one else, and that was
natural enough. But when I explained to him my reasons,
as I had many times explained them to M. Cabrion,
tears started to his eyes. From that time I said to
myself, M. Germain is very kind-hearted, and there is
nothing to be said against him, but his weeping so.
And so, you see, M. Rodolph, my reproaching him with
his sadness has made me unhappy now. Then I could
not understand why any one was melancholy, but now
I understand it but too well. But now my packet is
completed, and my work is ready for delivery. Will
you hand me my shawl, neighbour? It is not cold
enough to take a cloak, is it?"</p>

<p>"We shall go and return in a coach."</p>

<p>"True; we shall go and return very quickly, and
that will be so much gained."</p>

<p>"But, now I think of it, what are you to do? Your
work will suffer from your visits to the prison."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no; I have made my calculations. In the
first place, I have my Sundays to myself, so I shall go
and see Louise and Germain on those days; that will
serve me for a walk and a change. Then, in the week,
I shall go again to the prison once or twice. Each time
will occupy me three good hours, won't it? Well, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
manage this comfortably, I shall work an hour more
every day, and go to bed at twelve o'clock instead of
eleven o'clock; that will be a clear gain of seven or
eight hours a week, which I can employ in going to see
Louise and Germain. You see I am richer than I
appear," added Rigolette, with a smile.</p>

<p>"And you have no fear that you will be overfatigued?"</p>

<p>"Bah! Not at all; I shall manage it. And, besides,
it can't last for ever."</p>

<p>"Here is your shawl, neighbour."</p>

<p>"Fasten it; and mind you don't prick me."</p>

<p>"Ah, the pin is bent."</p>

<p>"Well, then, clumsy, take another then,&mdash;from the
pincushion. Ah, I forgot! Will you do me a great
favour, neighbour?"</p>

<p>"Command me, neighbour."</p>

<p>"Mend me a good pen, with a broad nib, so that when
I return I may write to poor Germain, and tell him I
have executed all his commissions. He will have my
letter to-morrow morning in the prison, and that will
give him pleasure."</p>

<p>"Where are your pens?"</p>

<p>"There,&mdash;on the table; the knife is in the drawer.
Wait until I light my taper, for it begins to grow dusk."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall see better how to mend the pen."</p>

<p>"And I how to tie my cap."</p>

<p>Rigolette lighted a lucifer-match, and lighted a
wax-end in a small bright candlestick.</p>

<p>"The deuce,&mdash;a wax-light! Why, neighbour, what
extravagance!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what I burn costs but a very small trifle more
than a candle, and it's so much cleaner!"</p>

<p>"Not much dearer?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, they are not! I buy these wax-ends by the
pound, and a half a pound lasts nearly a year."</p>

<p>"But," said Rodolph, who was mending the pen very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
carefully, whilst the grisette was tying on her cap
before the glass, "I do not see any preparations for
your dinner."</p>

<p>"I have not the least appetite. I took a cup of milk
this morning, and I shall take another this evening,
with a small piece of bread, and that will be enough for
me."</p>

<p>"Then you will not take a dinner with me quietly
after we have been to Germain's?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, neighbour; but I am not in spirits,&mdash;my
heart is too heavy,&mdash;another time with pleasure.
But the evening when poor Germain leaves his prison,
I invite myself, and afterwards you shall take me to the
theatre. Is that a bargain?"</p>

<p>"It is, neighbour; and I assure you I will not forget
the engagement. But you refuse me this to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, M. Rodolph. I should be a very dull companion,
without saying a word about the time it would
occupy me; for, you see, at this moment, I really cannot
afford to be idle, or waste one single quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"Then, for to-day I renounce the pleasure."</p>

<p>"There is my parcel, neighbour. Now go out first,
and I will lock the door."</p>

<p>"Here's a capital pen for you; and now for the
parcel."</p>

<p>"Mind you don't rumple it; it is <i>pout-de-soie</i>, and
soon creases. Hold it in your hand,&mdash;carefully,&mdash;there,
in that way; that's it. Now go, and I will
show you a light."</p>

<p>And Rodolph descended the staircase, followed by
Rigolette.</p>

<p>At the moment when the two neighbours were passing
by the door of the porter's lodge they saw M. Pipelet,
who, with his arms hanging down, was advancing towards
them from the bottom of the passage, holding in one hand
the sign which announced his Partnership of Friendship
with Cabrion, and in the other the portrait of the confounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
painter. Alfred's despair was so overwhelming
that his chin touched his breast, so that the wide crown
of his bell-shaped hat was easily seen. Seeing him thus,
with his head lowered, coming towards Rodolph and
Rigolette, he might have been compared to a ram, or
a brave Breton, preparing for combat.</p>

<p>Anastasie soon appeared on the threshold of the
lodge, and exclaimed, at her husband's appearance:</p>

<p>"Well, dearest old boy, here you are! And what did
the commissary say to you? Alfred, Alfred, mind
what you're doing, or you'll poke your head against my
king of lodgers. Excuse him, M. Rodolph. It is that
vagabond of a Cabrion, who uses him worse and worse.
He'll certainly turn my dear old darling into a donkey!
Alfred, love, speak to me!"</p>

<p>At this voice, so dear to his heart, M. Pipelet raised
his head. His features were impressed with a bitter
agony.</p>

<p>"What did the commissary say to you?" inquired
Anastasie.</p>

<p>"Anastasie, we must collect the few things we possess,
embrace our friends, pack up our trunk, and expatriate
ourselves from Paris,&mdash;from France,&mdash;from my beautiful
France; for now, assured of impunity, the monster
is capable of pursuing me everywhere, throughout the
length and breadth of the departments of the kingdom."</p>

<p>"What, the commissary?"</p>

<p>"The commissary," exclaimed M. Pipelet, with fierce
indignation,&mdash;"the commissary laughed in my teeth!"</p>

<p>"At you,&mdash;a man of mature age, with an air so
respectable that you would appear as silly as a goose
if one did not know your virtues?"</p>

<p>"Well, notwithstanding that, when I had respectfully
deposed in his presence my mass of complaints and vexations
against that infernal Cabrion, the magistrate, after
having looked and laughed&mdash;yes, laughed, and, I may
add, laughed indecorously&mdash;at the sign and the portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
which I brought with me as corroborative testimony,&mdash;the
magistrate replied, 'My good fellow, this Cabrion is
a wag,&mdash;a practical joker. But pay no attention to his
pleasantries. I advise you to laugh at him, and heartily,
too, for really there is ample cause to do so.' 'To laugh
at it, sir-r-r!' I exclaimed,&mdash;'to laugh at it, when grief
consumes me,&mdash;when this scamp poisons my very existence;
he placards me, and will drive me out of my wits.
I demand that they imprison, exile the monster,&mdash;at least
from my street!' At these words the commissary
smiled, and politely pointed to the door. I understood
the magistrate, sighed, and&mdash;and&mdash;here I am!"</p>

<p>"Good-for-nothing magistrate!" exclaimed Madame
Pipelet.</p>

<p>"It is all over, Anastasie,&mdash;all is ended,&mdash;hope
ceases. There's no justice in France; I am really
atrociously sacrificed."</p>

<p>And, by way of peroration, M. Pipelet dashed the sign
and portrait to the farther end of the passage with all
his force. Rodolph and Rigolette had in the shade
smiled at M. Pipelet's despair. After having said
a few words of consolation to Alfred, whom Anastasie
was trying to calm as well as she could, the king of
lodgers left the house in the Rue du Temple with
Rigolette, and they both got into a coach to go to
François Germain's.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h5>THE WILL.</h5>


<p>François Germain resided No. 11 Boulevard St.
Denis. It may not be amiss to recall to the reader,
who has probably forgotten the circumstance, that Madame
Mathieu, the diamond-matcher, whose name has
been already mentioned as the person for whom Morel
the lapidary worked, lodged in the same house as Germain.
During the long ride from the Rue du Temple
to the Rue St. Honoré, where dwelt the dressmaker
for whom Rigolette worked, Rodolph had ample opportunities
of more fully appreciating the fine natural disposition
of his companion. Like all instinctively noble
and devoted characters, she appeared utterly unconscious
of the delicacy and generosity of her conduct, all she
said and did seeming to her as the most simple and
matter-of-course thing possible.</p>

<p>Nothing would have been more easy than for Rodolph
to provide liberally both for Rigolette's present and
future wants, and thus to have enabled her to carry her
consoling attentions to Louise and Germain, without
grieving over the loss of that time which was necessarily
taken from her work,&mdash;her sole dependence; but the
prince was unwilling to diminish the value of the grisette's
devotion by removing all the difficulties, and,
although firmly resolved to bestow a rich reward on the
rare and beautiful qualities he hourly discovered in her,
he determined to follow her to the termination of this
new and interesting trial. It is scarcely necessary to
say that, had the health of the young girl appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
suffer in the smallest degree from the increase of labour
she so courageously imposed on herself, in order to dedicate
a portion of each week to the unhappy daughter of
the lapidary and the son of the Schoolmaster, Rodolph
would instantaneously have stepped forward to her aid;
and he continued to study with equal pleasure and emotion
the workings of a nature so naturally disposed to
view everything on its sunny side, so full of internal
happiness, and so little accustomed to sorrow that occasionally
she would smile, and seem the mirthful creature
nature had made her, spite of all the grief by which
she was surrounded.</p>

<p>At the end of about an hour, the <i>fiacre</i>, returning
from the Rue St. Honoré, stopped before a modest,
unpretending sort of house, situated No. 11 Boulevard
St. Denis. Rodolph assisted Rigolette to alight. The
young sempstress then proceeded to the porter's lodge,
where she communicated Germain's intentions, without
forgetting the promised gratuity.</p>

<p>Owing to the extreme amenity of his disposition, the
son of the Schoolmaster was unusually beloved, and the
<i>confrère</i> of M. Pipelet was deeply grieved to learn that
so quiet and well-conducted a lodger was about to quit
the house, and to that purpose the worthy porter warmly
expressed himself. Having obtained a light, Rigolette
proceeded to rejoin her companion, having first arranged
with the porter that he should not follow her up-stairs
till a time she indicated should have elapsed, and then
merely to receive his final orders. The chamber occupied
by Germain was situated on the fourth floor. When
they reached the door, Rigolette handed the key to
Rodolph, saying:</p>

<p>"Here, will you open the door? My hand trembles
so violently, I cannot do it. I fear you will laugh at
me. But, when I think that poor Germain will never
more enter this room, I seem as though I were about to
pass the threshold of a chamber of death."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come, my good neighbour, try and exert yourself;
you must not indulge such thoughts as these."</p>

<p>"I know it is wrong; but, indeed, I cannot help it."
And here Rigolette tried to dry up the tears with which
her eyes were filled.</p>

<p>Without being equally affected as his companion,
Rodolph still experienced a deep and painful emotion
as he penetrated into this humble abode. Well aware of
the detestable pertinacity with which the accomplices
of the Schoolmaster pursued, and were possibly still pursuing,
Germain, he pictured to himself the many hours
the unfortunate youth was constrained to pass in this
cheerless solitude. Rigolette placed the light on the
table. Nothing could possibly be more simple than
the fittings-up of the apartment itself. Its sole furniture
consisted of a small bed, a chest of drawers, a walnut-tree
bureau, four rush-bottomed chairs, and a table;
white calico curtains hung from the windows and around
the bed. The only ornament the mantelpiece presented
was a water-bottle and glass. The bed was made; but,
by the impression left on it, it would seem that Germain
had thrown himself on it without undressing on the
night previous to his arrest.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said Rigolette, sadly, as she examined
each minute detail of the interior of the apartment; "it
is very easy to see I was not near him. His room is
tidy, to be sure, but not as neat as it ought to be. Everything
is covered with dust. The curtains are smoke-dried,
the windows want cleaning, and the floor is not
kept as it should be. Oh, dear, what a difference!
The Rue du Temple was not a better room, but it had
a much more cheerful look, because everything was kept
so bright and clean,&mdash;like in my apartment!"</p>

<p>"Because in the Rue du Temple he had the benefit of
your advice and assistance."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray look here!" cried Rigolette, pointing to
the bed. "Only see,&mdash;the poor fellow never went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
to bed at all the last night he was here! How uneasy
he must have been! See, he has left his handkerchief
on his pillow, quite wet with his tears! I can see that
plainly enough." Then, taking up the handkerchief,
she added, "Germain has kept a small, orange-coloured
silk cravat I gave him once during our happy days. I have
a great mind to keep this handkerchief in remembrance
of his misfortune. Do you think he would be angry?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, he would but be too much delighted
with such a mark of your affection."</p>

<p>"Ah, but we must not indulge in such thoughts now;
let us attend to more serious matters. I will make up
a parcel of linen from the contents of those drawers,
ready to take to the prison, and Mother Bouvard, whom
I will send to-morrow, will see to the rest; but first of
all I will open the bureau, in order to get out the papers
and money Germain wished me to take charge of."</p>

<p>"But, now I think of it, Louise Morel gave me
back yesterday the thirteen hundred francs in gold she
received from Germain, to pay the lapidary's debt,
which I had already discharged. I have this money
about me; it justly belongs to Germain, since he repaid
the notary what he withdrew from the cash-box. I will
place it in your hands, in order that you may add it to
the sum entrusted to your care."</p>

<p>"Just as you like, M. Rodolph, although really I
should prefer not having so large a sum in my possession,
really there are so many dishonest people nowadays!
As for papers, that's quite another thing; I'll
willingly take charge of as many papers as you please,
but money is such a dangerous thing!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right; then I tell you what we will
do&mdash;eh, neighbour? I will be banker, and undertake
the responsibility of guarding this money. Should Germain
require anything, you can let me know; I will
leave you my address, and whatever you send for shall
be punctually and faithfully sent."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, yes, that will be very much better! How
good of you to offer, for I could not have ventured to
propose such a thing to you! So that is settled; I will
beg of you, also, to take whatever this furniture sells
for. And now let us see about the papers," continued
Rigolette, opening the bureau and pulling out several
drawers. "Ah, I dare say this is it! See what a large
packet! But, oh, good gracious, M. Rodolph, do pray
look what mournful words these are written on the
outside!"</p>

<p>And here Rigolette, in a faltering voice, read as
follows:</p>

<p>"'In the event of my dying by either a violent or
natural death, I request whoever may open this bureau
to carry these papers to Mlle. Rigolette, dressmaker, No.
17 Rue du Temple.' Do you think, M. Rodolph, that I
may break the seals of the envelope?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly; does not Germain expressly say that
among the papers you will find a letter particularly
addressed to yourself?"</p>

<p>The agitated girl broke the seals which secured the
outward cover, and from it fell a quantity of papers, one
of which, bearing the superscription of Mlle. Rigolette,
contained these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Mademoiselle</span>:&mdash;When this letter reaches your hands, I
shall be no more, if, as I fear, I should perish by a violent death,
through falling into a snare similar to that from which I lately
escaped. A few particulars herein enclosed, and entitled 'Notes
on My Life,' may serve to discover my murderers."</p>
</div>

<p>"Ah, M. Rodolph," cried Rigolette, interrupting herself,
"I am no longer astonished poor Germain was so
melancholy! How very dreadful to be continually
pursued by such ideas!"</p>

<p>"He must, indeed, have suffered deeply; but, trust
me, his worst misfortunes are over."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas, M. Rodolph, I trust it may prove so! Still,
to be in prison, and accused of theft!"</p>

<p>"Make yourself quite easy about him; his innocence
once proved, instead of returning to his former seclusion
and loneliness, he will regain his friends. You, first
and foremost, and then a dearly loved mother, from
whom he has been separated from his childhood."</p>

<p>"His mother! Has he, then, still a mother?"</p>

<p>"He has, but she has long believed him lost to her
for ever. Imagine her delight at seeing him again,
cleared from the unworthy charge now brought against
him. You see I was right in saying that his greatest
troubles were over; do not mention his mother to him.
I entrust you with the secret, because you take so generous
an interest in the fate of Germain that it is but
due to your devotedness that you should be tranquillised
as to his future fate."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, M. Rodolph! I promise you to guard
the secret as carefully as you could do."</p>

<p>Rigolette then proceeded with the perusal of Germain's
letter; it continued thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'Should you deign, mademoiselle, to cast your eyes over these
notes, you will find that I have been unfortunate all my life,
always unhappy, except during the hours I have passed with you;
you will find sentiments I should never have ventured to express
by words fully revealed in a sort of memorandum, entitled "My
Only Days of Happiness." Nearly every evening, after quitting
you, I thus poured forth the cheering thoughts with which your
affection inspired me, and which only sweetened the bitterness of
a cup full even to overflowing. That which was but friendship
in you, was, in my breast, the purest, the sincerest love; but of
that love I have never spoken. No, I reserved its full disclosure
till the moment should arrive when I could be but as an object
of your sorrowing recollection. No, never would I have sought
to involve you in a destiny as thoroughly miserable as my own.
But, when your eye peruses these pages, there will be nothing to
fear from the power of my ill-starred fate. I shall have been
your faithful friend, your adoring lover, but I shall no longer be
dangerous to your future happiness in either sense. I have but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
one last wish and desire, and I trust that you will kindly accomplish
it. I have witnessed the noble courage with which you
labour day by day, as well as the care and management requisite
to make your hard-earned gain suffice for your moderate wants.
Often have I shuddered at the bare idea of your being reduced
by illness (brought on, probably, by overattention to your work)
to a state too frightful to dwell upon. And it is no small consolation
to me to believe it in my power to spare you, not only a
considerable share of personal inconvenience, but also to preserve
you from evils your unsuspicious nature dreams not of.'</p>
</div>

<p>"What does that last part mean, M. Rodolph?" asked
Rigolette, much surprised.</p>

<p>"Proceed with the letter; we shall see by and by."</p>

<p>Rigolette thus resumed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'I know upon how little you can live, and of what service
even a small sum would be to you in any case of emergency. I
am very poor myself, but still, by dint of rigid economy, I have
managed to save fifteen hundred francs, which are placed in the
hands of a banker; it is all I am worth in the world, but by my
will, which you will find with this, I have ventured to bequeath
it to you; and I trust you will not refuse to accept this last
proof of the sincere affection of a friend and brother, from whom
death will have separated you when this meets your eye.'</p>
</div>

<p>"Oh, M. Rodolph," cried Rigolette, bursting into
tears, "this is too much! Kind, good Germain, thus
to consider my future welfare! What an excellent
heart he must have!"</p>

<p>"Worthy and noble-minded young man!" rejoined
Rodolph, with deep emotion. "But calm yourself, my
good girl. Thank God, Germain is still living! And,
by anticipating the perusal of his last wishes, you will
at least have learned how sincerely he loved you,&mdash;nay,
still loves you!"</p>

<p>"And only to think," said Rigolette, drying up her
tears, "that I should never once have suspected it!
When first I knew M. Girandeau and M. Cabrion, they
were always talking to me of their violent love, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
flames, and darts, and such stuff; but finding I took no
notice of them, they left off wearying me with such nonsense.
Now, on the contrary, Germain never named
love to me. When I proposed to him that we should
be good friends, he accepted the offer as frankly as it
was made, and ever after that we were always excellent
companions and neighbours; but&mdash;now I don't mind
telling you, M. Rodolph, that I was not sorry Germain
never talked to me in the same silly strain."</p>

<p>"But still it astonished you, did it not?"</p>

<p>"Why, M. Rodolph, I ascribed it to his melancholy,
and I fancied his low spirits prevented his joking like
the others."</p>

<p>"And you felt angry with him, did you not, for always
being so sad?"</p>

<p>"No," said the grisette, ingenuously; "no, I excused
him, because it was the only fault he had. But now
that I have read his kind and feeling letter, I cannot
forgive myself for ever having blamed him even for that
one thing."</p>

<p>"In the first place," said Rodolph, smiling, "you find
that he had many and just causes for his sadness; and
secondly, that, spite of his melancholy, he did love you
deeply and sincerely."</p>

<p>"To be sure; and it seems a thing to be proud of, to
be loved by so excellent a young man!"</p>

<p>"Whose love you will, no doubt, return one of these
days?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, M. Rodolph, though it is
very likely, for poor Germain is so much to be pitied.
I can imagine myself in his place. Suppose, just when
I fancied myself despised and forsaken by all the world,
some one whom I loved very dearly should evince for
me more regard than I had ventured to hope for, don't
you think it would make me very happy?" Then, after
a short silence, Rigolette continued, with a sigh, "On the
other hand, we are both so poor that, perhaps, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
be very imprudent. Ah, well, M. Rodolph, I must not
think of such things. Perhaps, too, I deceive myself.
One thing, however, is quite sure, and that is, that so
long as Germain remains in prison I will do all in my
power for him. It will be time enough when he has
regained his liberty for me to determine whether 'tis
love or friendship I feel for him. Until then it would
only torment me needlessly to try to make up my mind
what I had better do. But it is getting late, M. Rodolph.
Will you have the goodness to collect all those papers,
while I make up a parcel of linen? Ah, I forgot the
little bag containing the little orange-coloured cravat I
gave him. No doubt it is here&mdash;in this drawer. Oh,
yes, this is it. Oh, see, what a pretty bag! How nicely
embroidered! Poor Germain! I declare he has kept
such a trifle as this little handkerchief with as much care
as though it had been some holy relic. I well remember
the last time I had it around my throat; and when I
gave it to him, poor fellow, how very pleased he was!"</p>

<p>At this moment some one knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" inquired Rodolph.</p>

<p>"Want to speak to Ma'am Mathieu," replied a harsh,
hoarse voice, and in a tone which is peculiar to the
lowest orders. (Madame Mathieu was the matcher of
precious stones to whom we have before referred.)</p>

<p>This voice, whose accent was peculiar, awoke some
vague recollections in Rodolph's breast; and, desirous
of elucidating them, he took the light, and went himself
to open the door. He found himself confronted by a
man who was one of the frequenters of the <i>tapis-franc</i>
of the ogress, and recognised him instantly, so deeply
was the print of vice stamped upon him, so completely
marked on his beardless and youthful features. It
was Barbillon.</p>

<p>Barbillon, the pretended hackney-coachman, who had
driven the Schoolmaster and the Chouette to the hollow
way of Bouqueval,&mdash;Barbillon, the assassin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
husband of the unhappy milkwoman, who had set the
labourers of the farm at Arnouville on against La
Goualeuse. Whether this wretch had forgotten Rodolph's
face, which he had never seen but once at the
<i>tapis-franc</i> of the ogress, or that the change of dress
prevented him from recognising the Chourineur's conqueror,
he did not evince the slightest surprise at his
appearance.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" inquired Rodolph.</p>

<p>"Here's a letter for Ma'am Mathieu, and I must give
it to her myself," was Barbillon's reply.</p>

<p>"She does not live here,&mdash;it's opposite," said Rodolph.</p>

<p>"Thank ye, master. They told me the left-hand door;
but I've mistook."</p>

<p>Rodolph did not recollect the name of the diamond-matcher,
which Morel the lapidary had only mentioned
once or twice, and thus had no motive for interesting
himself in the female to whom Barbillon came with his
message; but yet, although ignorant of the ruffian's
crimes, his face was so decidedly repulsive that he
remained at the threshold of the door, curious to see the
person to whom Barbillon brought the letter.</p>

<p>Barbillon had scarcely knocked at the door opposite
to Germain's, than it opened, and the jewel-matcher, a
stout woman of about fifty, appeared with a candle in
her hand.</p>

<p>"Ma'am Mathieu?" inquired Barbillon.</p>

<p>"That's me, my man."</p>

<p>"Here's a letter, and I waits for an answer."</p>

<p>And Barbillon made a step forward to enter the doorway,
but the woman made him a sign to remain where
he was, and unsealed the letter, which she read by the
light of the candle she held, and then replied with an
air of satisfaction:</p>

<p>"Say it's all right, my man, and I will bring what is
required. I will be there at the same hour as usual.
My respects to the lady."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, missus. Please to remember the porter!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you must ask them as sent you; they are richer
than I am." And she shut the door.</p>

<p>Rodolph returned to Germain's room, when he saw
Barbillon run quickly down the staircase. The ruffian
found on the boulevard a man of low-lived, brutal
appearance, waiting for him in front of a shop.
Although the passers-by could hear (it is true they
could not comprehend), Barbillon appeared so delighted
that he could not help saying to his companion:</p>

<p>"Come and 'lush a drain of red tape,' Nicholas; the
old mot swallows the bait, hook and all. She'll show
at the Chouette's. Old Mother Martial will lend a hand
to peel her of the swag, and a'terwards we can box the
'cold meat' in your 'barkey.'"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> "Come and let's have some brandy together, Nicholas. The old woman
falls easily into the snare. She will come to the Chouette's; Mother Martial
will help us to take her jewels from her forcibly, and then we can remove
the dead body away in your boat."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Let's mizzle,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> then; for I must get back to Asnières
early, or else my brother Martial will smell summut."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> "Let's be quick, then."</p></div>
</div>

<p>And the two robbers, after having exchanged these
words in their own slang, went towards the Rue St.
Denis.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Some minutes afterwards Rigolette and Rodolph left
Germain's, got into the hackney-coach, and reached the
Rue du Temple.</p>

<p>The coach stopped.</p>

<p>At the moment when the door opened, Rodolph
recognised by the light of the dram-shop lamps his
faithful Murphy, who was waiting for him at the door
of the entrance.</p>

<p>The squire's presence always announced some serious
and sudden event, for it was he alone who knew at all
times where to find the prince.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" inquired Rodolph, quickly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
whilst Rigolette was collecting several things out of
the vehicle.</p>

<p>"A terrible circumstance, monseigneur!"</p>

<p>"Speak, in heaven's name!"</p>

<p>"M. the Marquis d'Harville&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You alarm me!"</p>

<p>"Had several friends to breakfast with him this morning.
He was in high spirits, had never been more joyous,
when a fatal imprudence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pray come to the point&mdash;pray!"</p>

<p>"And playing with a pistol, which he did not believe
to be loaded&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wounded himself seriously."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Something dreadful!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He is dead!"</p>

<p>"D'Harville! Ah, how horrible!" exclaimed Rodolph,
in a tone so agonised that Rigolette, who was at the
moment quitting the coach with the parcels, said:</p>

<p>"Alas! what ails you, M. Rodolph?"</p>

<p>"Some very distressing information I have just told
my friend, mademoiselle," said Murphy to the young
girl, for the prince was so overcome that he could
not reply.</p>

<p>"Is it, then, some dreadful misfortune?" said
Rigolette, trembling all over.</p>

<p>"Very dreadful, indeed!" replied the squire.</p>

<p>"Yes, most awful!" said Rodolph, after a few
moment's silence; then recollecting Rigolette, he said
to her, "Excuse me, my dear neighbour, if I do not go
up to your room with you. To-morrow I will send you
my address, and an order to go to see Germain in his
prison. I will soon see you again."</p>

<p>"Ah, M. Rodolph, I assure you that I share in the
grief you now experience! I thank you very much for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
having accompanied me; but I shall soon see you again,
sha'n't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, very soon."</p>

<p>"Good evening, M. Rodolph," added Rigolette, and
then disappeared down the passage with the various
things she had brought away from Germain's room.</p>

<p>The prince and Murphy got into the hackney-coach,
which took them to the Rue Plumet. Rodolph immediately
wrote the following note to Clémence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Madame</span>:&mdash;I have this instant learned the sudden blow
which has struck you, and deprived me of one of my best friends.
I forbear any attempt to portray my horror and my regret. Yet I
must mention to you certain circumstances unconnected with this
cruel event. I have just learned that your stepmother, who has
been, no doubt, in Paris for several days, returns this evening to
Normandy, taking with her Polidori. No doubt but this fact
will convince you of the peril which threatens your father; and
pray allow me to give you some advice, which I think requisite.
After the appalling event of this morning, every one must but too
easily conceive your anxiety to quit Paris for some time; go,
therefore, go at once, to Aubiers, so that you may arrive there
before your stepmother, or, at least, as soon as she. Make yourself
easy, madame, for I shall watch at a distance, as well as
close, the abominable projects of your stepmother. Adieu,
madame; I write these few lines to you in great haste. My
heart is lacerated when I remember yesterday evening, when I
left him,&mdash;him,&mdash;more tranquil and more happy than he had
been for a very long time.</p>

<p class="indent">"Believe, madame, in my deep and lasting devotion,</p>

<p class="sigs">"<span class="smcap">Rodolph</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>Following the prince's advice, three hours after she
had received this letter, Madame d'Harville, accompanied
by her daughter, was on the road to Normandy. A post-chaise,
despatched from Rodolph's mansion, followed in
the same route. Unfortunately, in the troubled state into
which this complication of events and the hurry of her
departure had driven her, Clémence had forgotten to
inform the prince that she had met Fleur-de-Marie at
St. Lazare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Our readers may, perhaps, remember that, on the
previous evening, the Chouette had been menacing
Madame Séraphin, and threatening to unfold the whole
history of La Goualeuse's existence, affirming that she
knew (and she spoke truth) where the young girl then
was. The reader may also recollect that, after this conversation,
the notary, Jacques Ferrand, dreading the
disclosure of his criminal course, believed that he had
a strong motive for effecting the disappearance of La
Goualeuse, whose existence, once known, would compromise
him fatally. He had, in consequence, written
to Bradamanti, one of his accomplices, to come to him
that they might together arrange a fresh plot, of which
Fleur-de-Marie was to be the victim. Bradamanti, occupied
by the no less pressing interests of Madame d'Harville's
stepmother, who had her own sinister motives for
taking the charlatan with her to M. d'Orbigny, finding
it, no doubt, more profitable to serve his ancient female
ally, did not attend to the notary's appointment, but set
out for Normandy without seeing Madame Séraphin.</p>

<p>The storm was gathering over the head of Jacques
Ferrand. During the day the Chouette had returned to
reiterate her threats; and to prove that they were not
vain, she declared to the notary that the little girl,
formerly abandoned by Madame Séraphin, was then a
prisoner in St. Lazare, under the name of La Goualeuse;
and that if he did not give ten thousand francs (400<i>l.</i>)
in three days, this young girl would receive the papers
which belonged to her, and which would instruct her
that she had been confided in her infancy to the care of
Jacques Ferrand. According to his custom, the notary
denied all boldly, and drove the Chouette away as an
impudent liar, although he was perfectly convinced, and
greatly alarmed at the dangerous drift of her threats.
Thanks to his numerous connections, the notary found
means to ascertain that very day (during the conversation
of Fleur-de-Marie and Madame d'Harville) that La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Goualeuse was actually a prisoner in St. Lazare, and so
marked for her good conduct that they were expecting
her discharge every moment. Thus informed, Jacques
Ferrand, having determined on his deadly scheme, felt
that, in order to carry it into execution, Bradamanti's
help was more than ever indispensable; and thereon
came Madame Séraphin's vain attempts to see the
doctor. Having at length heard, in the evening, of
the departure of the charlatan, the notary, driven to
act by the imminence of his fears and danger, recalled
to mind the Martial family, those freshwater pirates
established near the bridge of Asnières, with whom
Bradamanti had proposed to place Louise, in order to
get rid of her undetected. Having absolutely need of
an accomplice to carry out his deadly purposes against
Fleur-de-Marie, the notary took every precaution not to
be compromised in case a fresh crime should be committed;
and, the day after Bradamanti's departure for
Normandy, Madame Séraphin went with all speed to the
Martials.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h5>L'ILE DU RAVAGEUR.</h5>


<p>The following scenes took place during the evening of
the day in which Madame Séraphin, in compliance with
Jacques Ferrand the notary's orders, went to the Martials,
the freshwater pirates established at the point of
a small islet of the Seine, not far from the bridge of
Asnières.</p>

<p>The Father Martial had died, like his own father, on
the scaffold, leaving a widow, four sons, and two daughters.
The second of these sons was already condemned
to the galleys for life, and of the rest of this numerous
family there remained in the Ile du Ravageur (a name
which was popularly given to this place; why, we will
hereafter explain) the Mother Martial; three sons, the
eldest (La Louve's lover) twenty-five years of age, the
next twenty, and the youngest twelve; two girls, one
eighteen years of age, the second nine.</p>

<p>The examples of such families, in whom there is
perpetuated a sort of fearful inheritance of crime, are
but too frequent. And this must be so. Let us repeat,
unceasingly, society thinks of punishing, but never of
preventing, crime. A criminal is sentenced to the
galleys for life; another is executed. These felons will
leave young families; does society take any care or
heed of these orphans,&mdash;these orphans, whom it has
made so, by visiting their father with a civil death, or
cutting off his head? Does it substitute any careful
or preserving guardianship after the removal of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
whom the law has declared to be unworthy, infamous,&mdash;after
the removal of him whom the law has put to
death? No; "the poison dies with the beast," says
society. It is deceived; the poison of corruption is so
subtle, so corrosive, so contagious, that it becomes almost
invariably hereditary; but, if counteracted in time, it
would never be incurable. Strange contradiction! Dissection
proves that a man dies of a malady that may
be transmitted, and then, by precautionary measures,
his descendants are preserved from the affection of
which he has been the victim. Let the same facts be
produced in the moral order of things; let it be demonstrated
that a criminal almost always bequeaths to his
son the germ of a precocious depravity. Will society
do for the safety of this young soul what the doctor
does for the body, when it is a question of contending
against hereditary vitiation? No; instead of curing
this unhappy creature, we leave him to be gangrened,
even to death; and then, in the same way as the people
believe the son of the executioner to be an executioner,
perforce, also, they will believe the son of a criminal
also a criminal. And then we consider that the result
of an inheritance inexorably fatal, which is really a
corruption caused by the egotistical neglect of society.
Thus, if, in spite of the evil mark on his name, the
orphan, whom the law has made so, remains, by chance,
industrious and honest, a barbarous prejudice will still
reflect on him his father's offences; and thus subjected
to undeserved reprobation, he will scarcely find employment.
And, instead of coming to his aid, to save him
from discouragement, despair, and, above all, the dangerous
resentments of injustice, which sometimes drive
the most generous disposition to revolt to ill, society
will say:</p>

<p>"Let him go wrong if he will,&mdash;we shall watch him.
Have we not gaolers, turnkeys, and executioners?"</p>

<p>Thus for him who (and it is as rare as it is meritorious)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
preserves himself pure in spite of the worst examples,
is there any support, any encouragement? Thus
for him who, plunged from his birth in a focus of
domestic depravity, is vitiated quite young, what hope
is there of cure?</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will cure him, the orphan I have made,"
replies society; "but in my own way,&mdash;by and by.
To extirpate the smallpox, to cut out the imposthume,
it must come to a head."</p>

<p>A criminal desires to speak.</p>

<p>"Prisons and galleys, they are my hospitals. In
incurable cases there is the executioner. As to the cure
of my orphan," adds society, "I will reflect upon it.
Let the germ of hereditary corruption ripen; let it
increase; let it extend its ravages far and wide. When
our man shall be rotten to the heart, when crime oozes
out of him at every pore, when a robbery or desperate
murder shall have placed him at the same bar of infamy
at which his father stood, then we will cure this inheritor
of crime,&mdash;as we cured his progenitor. At the galleys
or on the scaffold the son will find his father's seat still
warm."</p>

<p>Society thus reasons; and it is astonished, and indignant,
and frightened, to see how robberies and murders
are handed down so fatally from generation to generation.</p>

<p>The dark picture which is now to follow&mdash;The
Freshwater Pirates&mdash;is intended to display what the
inheritance of evil in a family may be when society does
not come legally or officially to preserve the unfortunate
victims of the law from the terrible consequences of the
sentence executed against the father.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> In proportion as we advance in this work, its moral aim is attacked with
so much bitterness, and, as we think, with so much injustice, that we ask
permission to dwell a little on the serious and honourable idea which hitherto
has sustained and guided us. Many serious, delicate, and lofty minds, being
desirous of encouraging us in our endeavours, and having forwarded to us
the flattering testimonials of their approval, it is due, perhaps, to these
known and unknown friends to reply over again to the blind accusations
which have reached, we may say, even to the bosom of the legislative
assembly. To proclaim the odious immorality of our work is to proclaim
decidedly, it appears to us, the odiously immoral tendencies of the persons
who honour us with the deepest sympathies. It is in the name of these
sympathies, as well as in our own, that we shall endeavour to prove, by an
example selected from amongst others, that this work is not altogether
destitute of generous and practical ideas. We gave, some time back, the
sketch of a model farm founded by Rodolph, in order to encourage, teach,
and remunerate poor, honest, and industrious labourers. We add to this:
Honest men who are unfortunate deserve, at least, as much interest as
criminals; yet there are numerous associations intended for the patronage
of young prisoners, or those discharged, but there is no society founded for
the purpose of giving succour to poor young persons whose conduct has been
invariably exemplary. So that it is absolutely necessary to have committed
an offence to become qualified for these institutions, which are, unquestionably,
most meritorious and salutary. And we make a peasant of the Bouqueval
farm to say:
</p><p>
"It is humane and charitable not to make the wicked desperate, but it is
also requisite that the good should not be without hope. If a stout, sturdy,
honest fellow, desirous of doing well, and of learning all he can, were to
present himself at the farm for young ex-thieves, they would say to him,
'My lad, haven't you stolen some trifle, or been somewhat dissolute?' 'No!'
'Well, then, this is no place for you.'"
</p><p>
This discordance of things had struck minds much superior to our own,
and, thanks to them, what we considered as an utopianism was realised.
Under the superintendence of one of the most distinguished and most
honourable men of the age, M. le Comte Portalis, and under the able direction
of a real philanthropist with a generous heart and an enlightened and
practical mind, M. Allier, a society has been established for the purpose of
succouring poor and honest persons of the Department of the Seine, and of
employing them in agricultural colonies. This single and sole result is
sufficient to affirm the moral idea of our work. We are very proud and very
happy to have been met in the midst of our ideas, our wishes, and our hopes
by the founders of this new work of charity; for we are one of the most
obscure, but most convinced, propagators of these two great truths,&mdash;that it
is the duty of society to prevent evil, and to encourage and recompense good,
as much as in it lies.
</p><p>
Whilst we are speaking of this new work of charity, whose just and moral
idea ought to have a salutary and fruitful result, let us hope that its founders
will perchance think of supplying another vacancy, by extending hereafter
their tutelary patronage, or, at least, their solicitude, over young children
whose fathers have been executed, or condemned to an infamous sentence
involving civil death, and who, we will repeat, are made orphans by the act
and operation of the law. Such of these unfortunate children as shall be
already worthy of interest from their wholesome tendencies and their misery
will still more deserve particular notice, in consequence of their painful,
difficult, and dangerous position. Let us add: The family of a condemned
criminal, almost always victims of cruel repulses, apply in vain for labour,
and are compelled, in order to escape universal reprobation, to fly from the
spot where they have hitherto found work. Then, exasperated and enraged
by injustice, already branded as criminals, for faults of which they are
innocent, frequently at the end of all honourable resource, these unfortunates
would sink and die of famine if they remained honest. If they have,
on the other hand, already undergone an almost inevitable corruption, ought
we not to try and rescue them whilst there is yet time? The presence of
these orphans of the law in the midst of other children protected by the
society of whom we have spoken, would be, moreover, a useful example to
all. It would show that if the guilty is unfailingly punished, his family
lose nothing, but rather gain in the esteem of the world, if by dint of courage
and virtues they achieve the reëstablishing of a tarnished name. Shall we
say that the legislature desires to render the chastisement still more terrible
by virtually striking the criminal father in the fortune of his innocent son?
That would be barbarous, immoral, irrational. Is it not, on the contrary, of
the highest moral consequence to prove to the people that there is no
hereditary succession of evil; that the original stain is not ineffaceable?
</p><p>
Let us venture to hope that these reflections will appear deserving of
some attention from the new Society of Patronage. Unquestionably it is
painful to think that the state never takes the initiative in these questions
so vital and so deeply interesting to social organisation.</p></div>

<p>The ancestor of the Martial family who first established
himself on this islet, on payment of a moderate
rent, was a <i>ravageur</i> (a river-scavenger). The ravageurs,
as well as the <i>débardeurs</i> and <i>déchireurs</i> of boats, remain
nearly the whole of the day plunged in water up to the
waist in the exercise of their trade. The <i>débardeurs</i>
bring ashore the floating wood. The <i>déchireurs</i> break
up the rafts which have brought the wood. Equally
aquatic as these other two occupations, the business of
a <i>ravageur</i> is different. Going into the water as far
as possible, the <i>ravageur</i>, or mud-lark, draws up, by aid
of a long drag, the river sand from beneath the mud; then,
collecting it in large wooden bowls, he washes it like a
person washing for gold dust, and extracts from it metallic
particles of all kinds,&mdash;iron, copper, lead, tin, pewter,
brass,&mdash;the results of the relics of all sorts of utensils.
The <i>ravageurs</i>, indeed, often find in the sand fragments
of gold and silver jewelry, brought into the Seine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
either by the sewers which are washed by the stream,
or by the masses of snow or ice collected in the streets,
and which are cast into the river. We do not know by
what tradition or custom these persons, usually honest
and industrious, are called by a name so formidable.
Martial, the father, the first inhabitant of this islet,
being a <i>ravageur</i> (and a sad exception to his comrades),
the inhabitants of the river's banks called it the Ile du
Ravageur.</p>

<p>The dwelling of these freshwater pirates was placed
at the southern end of the island. In daytime there
was visible, on a sign-board over the door:</p>

<p class="center">"AU RENDEZVOUS DES RAVAGEURS.<br />
GOOD WINE, GOOD EELS, AND FRIED FISH.<br />
BOATS LET BY THE DAY OR HOUR."</p>

<p>We thus see that the head of this depraved family
added to his visible or hidden pursuits those of a public-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
keeper, fisherman, and letter of boats. The felon's
widow continued to keep the house, and reprobates,
vagrants, escaped convicts, wandering wild-beast showmen,
and scamps of every description came there to
pass Sundays and other days not marked with a red
letter in the calendar, in parties of pleasure. Martial
(La Louve's lover), the eldest son of the family, the
least guilty of all the family, was a river poacher, and
now and then, as a real champion, and for money paid,
took the part of the weak against the strong. One of
his brothers, Nicholas, the intended accomplice of Barbillon
in the murder of the jewel-matcher, was in appearance
a <i>ravageur</i>, but really a freshwater pirate in the
Seine and its banks. François, the youngest son of
the executed felon, rowed visitors who wished to go
on the river in a boat. We have alluded to Ambroise
Martial, condemned to the galleys for burglary at night
with attempt to murder. The eldest daughter, nicknamed
Calabash (<i>Calebasse</i>), helped her mother in the
kitchen, and waited on the company. Her sister,
Amandine, nine years of age, was also employed in the
house according to her years and strength.</p>

<p>At the period in question it was a dull night out of
doors; heavy, gray, opaque clouds, driven by the wind,
showed here and there in the midst of their openings a
few patches of dark blue spotted with stars. The outline
of the islet, bordered by high and ragged poplars,
was strongly and darkly defined in the clear haze of the
sky and in the white transparency of the river. The
house, with its irregular gables, was completely buried
in the shade; two windows in the ground floor only
were lighted, and these windows showed a deep red
light, which was reflected like long trails of fire in the
little ripples which washed the landing-place close to
the house. The chains of the boats which were moored
there made a continual clashing, that mingled unpleasantly
with the gusts of the wind in the branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of the poplars, and the hoarse murmurs of the main
stream.</p>

<p>A portion of the family was assembled in the kitchen
of the house. This was a large low-roofed apartment.
Facing the door were two windows, under which a long
stove extended. To the left hand there was a high
chimney; on the right a staircase leading to the upper
story. At the side of this staircase was the entrance to
a large room, containing several tables for the use of the
guests at the cabaret. The light of a lamp, joined to
the flame of the fire, was strongly reflected by a number
of saucepans and other copper utensils suspended against
the wall, or ranged on shelves with a quantity of earthenware;
and a large table stood in the middle of the kitchen.
The felon's widow, with three of her children, was seated
in the corner near the fireplace.</p>

<p>This woman, tall and meagre, seemed about five and
forty years of age. She was dressed in black, with a
mourning handkerchief tied about her head, concealing
her hair, and surrounding her flat, livid, and wrinkled
brows; her nose was long and straight; her cheek-bones
prominent; her cheeks furrowed; her complexion bilious
and sallow; the corners of her mouth, always curved
downwards, rendered still harsher the expression of her
countenance, as chilling, sinister, and immovable as a
marble mask. Her gray eyebrows surmounted her dull
blue eyes.</p>

<p>The felon's widow was employed with needlework, as
well as her two daughters. The eldest girl was tall and
forbidding like her mother, with her features, calm, harsh,
and repulsive, her thin nose, her ill-formed mouth, and
her pale look. Her yellow complexion, which resembled
a ripe quince, had procured for her the name of Calabash
(<i>Calebasse</i>). She was not in mourning, but wore a
brown gown, whilst a cap of black tulle did not conceal
two bands of scanty hair of dull and dingy light brown.</p>

<p>François, the youngest of the Martial sons, was sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
on a low stool repairing an <i>aldrel</i>, a thin-meshed net
forbidden to be used on the Seine. In spite of the tan
of his features, this boy seemed in perfect health; a
forest of red hair covered his head; his face was round,
his lips thick, his forehead projecting, his eyes quick and
piercing. He was not like his mother or his elder sister,
but had a subdued and sly look, as from time to time,
through the thick mass of hair that fell over his eyes, he
threw a stealthy and fearful glance at his mother, or
exchanged a look of intelligence and affection with his
little sister, Amandine.</p>

<p>The latter was seated beside her brother, and was
occupied, not in marking, but in unmarking, some linen
stolen on the previous evening. She was nine years old,
and was as like her brother as her sister was like her
mother. Her features, without being more regular, were
less coarse than those of François. Although covered
with freckles, her complexion was remarkably clear, her
lips thick and red, her hair also red, but silky, and her
eyes, though small, were of a clear bright blue. When
Amandine's look met that of her brother, she turned a
glance towards the door, and then François replied by
sigh; after which, calling his sister's attention by a slight
gesture, he counted with the end of his needle ten loops
of the net. This was meant to imply, in the symbolical
language of children, that their brother Martial would
not return until ten o'clock that evening.</p>

<p>Seeing these two women so silent and ill-looking, and
the two poor little mute, frightened, uneasy children, we
might suppose they were two executioners and two victims.
Calabash, perceiving that Amandine had ceased
from her occupation for a moment, said, in a harsh
tone:</p>

<p>"Come, haven't you done taking the mark out of that
shirt?"</p>

<p>The little girl bowed her head without making any
reply, and, by the aid of her fingers and scissors, hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
finished taking out the red cotton threads which marked
the letters in the linen.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Amandine, addressing the widow
timidly, showed her the shirt, and said:</p>

<p>"Mother, I have done it."</p>

<p>Without making any reply, the widow threw her
another piece of linen. The child did not catch it
quickly enough, and it fell on the ground. Her tall
sister gave her, with her hand as hard as wood, a sharp
slap on the arm, saying:</p>

<p>"You stupid brat!"</p>

<p>Amandine resumed her seat, and set to work actively,
after having exchanged with her brother a glance of her
eye, into which a tear had started.</p>

<p>The same silence continued to reign in the kitchen.
Without, the wind still moaned and dashed about the
sign in front of the house. This dismal creaking,
and the dull boiling of a pot placed over the fire, were
the only sounds that were heard. The two children
observed, with secret fright, that their mother did not
speak. Although she was habitually taciturn, this
complete silence, and a certain drawing in of the
lips, announced to them that the widow was in what
they called her white passion, that is to say, was a prey
to concentrated irritation.</p>

<p>The fire was going out for want of fuel.</p>

<p>"François, a log," said Calabash.</p>

<p>The young mender of forbidden nets looked into a
nook beside the chimney, and replied:</p>

<p>"There are no more there."</p>

<p>"Then go to the wood-pile," said Calabash.</p>

<p>François murmured some unintelligible words, but did
not stir.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me, François?" inquired Calabash,
harshly.</p>

<p>The felon's widow laid on her knees a towel she was
also unmarking, and looked at her son. He had lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
his head, but he guessed he felt, if we may use the
expression, the fierce look his mother cast upon him,
and, fearful of encountering her dreaded countenance,
the boy remained without stirring.</p>

<p>"I say, are you deaf, François?" said Calabash, in an
irritated tone. "Mother, you see!"</p>

<p>The tall sister seemed to be happy in finding fault
with the two children, and to seek for them the punishment
which the widow pitilessly inflicted. Amandine,
without being observed, gently touched her brother's
elbow, to make him quietly do what Calabash desired.
François did not stir. The elder sister still looked
at her mother as demanding the punishment of the
offender, and the widow understood her. With her
long lean finger she pointed to a stick of stout and
pliant willow placed in a recess near the chimney.
Calabash stooped forward, took up this staff of chastisement,
and handed it to her mother. François had
seen his mother's gesture, and, rising suddenly, sprung
out of the reach of the threatening stick.</p>

<p>"Do you want mother to break your back?" exclaimed
Calabash.</p>

<p>The widow, still holding the willow stick in her hand,
pinching her pale lips together more and more, looked at
François with a fixed eye, but without uttering a syllable.
By the slight tremor of Amandine's hands, with her head
bent downwards, and the redness which suddenly overspread
her neck, it was easy to see that the child, although
habituated to such scenes, was alarmed at the fate
that threatened her brother, who had taken refuge in a
corner of the kitchen, and seemed frightened and irritated.</p>

<p>"Mind yourself, mother's going to begin, and then it
will be too late!" said the tall sister.</p>

<p>"I don't care!" replied François, turning pale. "I'd
rather be beaten as I was the day before yesterday, than&mdash;go
to the wood-pile&mdash;and at night&mdash;again."</p>

<p>"And why?" asked Calabash, impatiently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am&mdash;afraid of the wood-pile&mdash;I&mdash;" answered
the boy, shuddering as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Afraid&mdash;you stupid! And of what?"</p>

<p>François shook his head, but did not reply.</p>

<p>"Will you answer? What are you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But I am frightened."</p>

<p>"Why, you've been there a hundred times, and last
night, too."</p>

<p>"I won't go there any more."</p>

<p>"Mother's going to begin."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for me," exclaimed the lad.
"But she may beat me, kill me, and I'll not go near
the wood-pile&mdash;not at night."</p>

<p>"Once more&mdash;why not?" inquired Calabash.</p>

<p>"Why, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Because there's some one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's some one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Buried there!" said François, with a shudder.</p>

<p>The felon's widow, in spite of her impassiveness, could
not repress a sudden start; her daughter did the same.
It seemed as though the two women were struck with an
electric shock.</p>

<p>"Some one buried by the wood-pile?" said Calabash,
shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I tell you that just now, whilst I was piling up some
wood, I saw in a dark corner near the wood-pile a dead
man's bone; it was sticking a little way out of the
ground where it was damp, just by the corner," added
François.</p>

<p>"Do you hear him, mother? Why, the boy's a fool!"
said Calabash, making a signal to the widow. "They
are mutton-bones I put there for washing-lye."</p>

<p>"It was not a mutton-bone," replied the boy, with
alarm, "it was a dead person's bones,&mdash;a dead man's
bones. I saw quite plainly a foot that stuck out of the
ground."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"And, of course, you told your brother, your dear
friend Martial, of your grand discovery, didn't you?"
asked Calabash, with brutal irony.</p>

<p>François made no reply.</p>

<p>"Nasty little spy!" said Calabash, savagely; "because
he is as cowardly as a cur, and would as soon see us
scragged, as our father was scragged before us."</p>

<p>"If you call me a spy, I'll tell my brother Martial
everything!" said François, much enraged. "I haven't
told him yet, for I haven't seen him since; but, when he
comes here this evening, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>The child could not finish; his mother came up to
him, calm and inexorable as ever. Although she habitually
stooped a little, her figure was still tall for a woman.
Holding the willow wand in one hand, with the other
the widow took her son by the arm, and, in spite of
alarm, resistance, prayers, and tears of the child, she
dragged him after her, and made him ascend the staircase
at the further end of the kitchen. After a moment's
interval, there was heard heavy trampling, mingled with
cries and sobs. Some minutes afterwards this noise
ceased. A door shut violently; the felon's widow descended.
Then, as impassive as ever, she put the stick
in its usual place, seated herself close to the fireplace,
and resumed her occupation, without saying a word.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h5>THE FRESHWATER PIRATE.</h5>


<p>After a silence of several minutes, the criminal's
widow said to her daughter:</p>

<p>"Go and get some wood; we will set the wood-pile
to rights when Nicholas and Martial return home this
evening."</p>

<p>"Martial! Do you mean to tell him also that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The wood, I say!" repeated the widow, abruptly
interrupting her daughter, who, accustomed to yield to
the imperious and iron rule of her mother, lighted a
lantern, and went out.</p>

<p>During the preceding scene, Amandine, deeply disquieted
concerning the fate of François, whom she
tenderly loved, had not ventured either to lift up her
eyes, or dry her tears, which fell, drop by drop, on
to her lap. Her sobs, which she dared not give utterance
to, almost suffocated her, and she strove even to
repress the fearful beatings of her heart. Blinded by
her fast gathering tears, she sought to conceal her emotion
by endeavouring to pick the mark from the chemise
given to her, but, from the nervous trembling of her
hand, she ran the scissors into her finger sufficiently
deep to cause considerable effusion of blood; but the
poor child thought much less of the pain she experienced
than of the certain punishment which awaited
her for staining the linen with her blood. Happily
for her, the widow was too deeply absorbed in profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
reflection to take any notice of what had occurred.
Calabash now returned, bearing a basket filled with
wood. To the inquiring look of her mother, she returned
an affirmative nod of the head, which was
intended to acquaint her with the fact of the dead
man's foot being actually above the ground. The widow
compressed her lips, and continued the work she was
occupied upon; the only difference perceptible in her
being that she plied her needle with increased rapidity.
Calabash, meanwhile, renewed the fire, superintended
the state of the cookery progressing in the saucepan
beside the hearth, and then resumed her seat near her
mother.</p>

<p>"Nicholas is not here yet," said she to her parent.
"It is to be hoped that the old woman who this morning
engaged him to meet a gentleman from Bradamanti has
not led him into any scrape. She had such a very offhand
way with her; she would neither give any explanation
as to the nature of the business Nicholas was wanted
for, nor tell her name, or where she came from."</p>

<p>The widow shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You do not consider Nicholas is in any danger, I
see, mother. And, after all, I dare say you are quite
right! The old woman desired him to be on the Quai
de Billy, opposite the landing-place, about seven o'clock
in the evening, and wait there for a person who wished
to speak with him, and who would utter the word
'Bradamanti' as a sort of countersign. Certainly
there is nothing very perilous in doing so much. No
doubt Nicholas is late from having to-day found, as he
did yesterday, something on the road. Look at this
capital linen which he contrived to filch from a boat,
in which a laundress had just left it!" So saying, she
pointed to one of the pieces of linen Amandine was
endeavouring to pick the mark out of. Then, addressing
the child, she said, "What do folks mean when
they talk of filching?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe," answered the frightened child, without
venturing to look up, "it means taking things that are
not ours."</p>

<p>"Oh, you little fool! It means stealing, not taking.
Do you understand?&mdash;stealing!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sister!"</p>

<p>"And when one can steal as cleverly as Nicholas,
there is no need to want for anything. Look at that
linen he filched yesterday; how comfortably it set us
all up; and that, too, with no other trouble than just
taking out the marks; isn't it true, mother?" added
Calabash, with a burst of laughter, which displayed her
decayed and irregular teeth, yellow and jaundiced as
her complexion.</p>

<p>The widow received this pleasantry with cold indifference.</p>

<p>"Talking of fitting ourselves up without any expense,"
continued Calabash, "it strikes me we might possibly do
so at another shop. You know quite well that an old
man has come, within the last few days, to live in the
country-house belonging to M. Griffon, the doctor of
the hospital at Paris. I mean that lone house about
a hundred steps from the river's side, just opposite the
lime-kilns,&mdash;eh, mother? You understand me, don't
you?"</p>

<p>The widow bowed her head, in token of assent.</p>

<p>"Well, Nicholas was saying yesterday that it was
very likely a good job might be made out of it," pursued
Calabash. "Now I have ascertained, this very morning,
that there is good booty to be found there. The best
way will be to send Amandine to watch the place a
little; no one will take notice of a child like her; and
she could pretend to be just playing about, and amusing
herself; all the time she can take notice of everything,
and will be able to tell us all she sees or hears. Do
you hear what I say?" added Calabash, roughly addressing
Amandine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sister," answered the trembling child; "I will
be sure to do as you wish me."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what you always say; but you never do
more than promise, you little slink! That time that I
desired you to take a five-franc piece out of the grocer's
till at Asnières, while I managed to keep the man occupied
at the other end of the shop, you did not choose to
obey me; and yet you might have done it so easily; no
one ever mistrusts a child. Pray what was your reason
for not doing as you were bid?"</p>

<p>"Because, sister, my heart failed me, and I was
afraid."</p>

<p>"And yet, the other day, you took a handkerchief out
of the peddler's pack, when the man was selling his
goods inside the public-house. Pray did he find it out,
you silly thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but, sister, you know the handkerchief was for
you, not me; and you made me do it. Besides, it was
not money."</p>

<p>"What difference does that make?"</p>

<p>"Oh, why, taking a handkerchief is not half so wicked
as stealing money!"</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said Calabash, contemptuously,
"these are mighty fine notions! I suppose it is Martial
stuffs your head with all this rubbish. I suppose
you will run open-mouthed to tell him every word we
have said,&mdash;eh, little spy? But Lord bless you! We
are not afraid of you or Martial either; you can neither
eat us nor drink us, that is one good thing." Then,
addressing herself to the widow, Calabash continued,
"I tell you what, mother, that fellow will get himself
into no good by trying to rule, and domineer, and lay
down the law here, as he does; both Nicholas and
myself are determined not to submit to it. He sets
both Amandine and François against everything either
you or I order them to do. Do you think this can last
much longer?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" said the mother, in a harsh, abrupt voice.</p>

<p>"Ever since his Louve has been sent to St. Lazare,
Martial has gone on like a madman, savage as a bear
with every one. Pray is it our fault? Can we help his
sweetheart being put in prison? Only let her show her
face here when she comes out, and I'll serve her in such
a way she sha'n't forget one while! I'll match her!
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the widow, who had been buried in profound
reflection, suddenly interrupted her daughter by saying:</p>

<p>"You think something profitable might be got out of
the old fellow who lives in the doctor's house, do you
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother!"</p>

<p>"He looks poor and shabby as any common beggar!"</p>

<p>"And, for all that, he is a nobleman."</p>

<p>"A nobleman?"</p>

<p>"True as you're alive! And, what's more, he carries
a purse full of gold, spite of his always going into Paris,
and returning, on foot, leaning on an old stick, just for
all the world like a poor wretch that had not a sou in
the world."</p>

<p>"How do you know that he has gold?"</p>

<p>"A little while ago I was at the post-office at
Asnières, to inquire whether there was any letter for
us from Toulon&mdash;"</p>

<p>At these words, which recalled the circumstance of
her son's confinement in the galleys, the brows of the
widow were contracted with a dark frown, while a half
repressed sigh escaped her lips. Unheeding these signs
of perturbation, Calabash proceeded:</p>

<p>"I was waiting my turn, when the old man who lives
at the doctor's house entered the office. I knew him
again directly, by his white hair and beard, his dark complexion,
and thick black eyebrows. He does not look
like one that would be easily managed, I can tell you;
and, spite of his age, he has the appearance of a determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
old fool that would die sooner than yield. He
walked straight up to the postmistress. 'Pray,' said he,
'have you any letters from Angers for M. le Comte de
Remy?' 'Yes,' replied the woman, 'here is one.'
'Then it is for me,' said the old man; 'here is my passport.'
While the postmistress was examining it, he
drew out a green silk purse, to pay the postage; and,
I promise you, one end was stuffed with gold till it
looked as large as an egg. I know it was gold, for I
saw the bright, yellow pieces shining through the
meshes of the purse; and I am quite certain there
must have been at least forty or fifty louis in it!"
cried Calabash, her eyes glowing with a covetous eagerness
to possess herself of such a treasure. "And only
to think," continued she, "of a person, with all that
money in his pocket, going about like an old beggar!
No doubt he is some old miser, too rich to be able to
count his hoards. One good thing, mother, we know
his name; that may assist us in gaining admittance into
the house. As soon as Amandine can find out for us
whether he has any servants or not&mdash;"</p>

<p>A loud barking of dogs here interrupted Calabash.</p>

<p>"Listen, mother," cried she; "no doubt the dogs
hear the sound of a boat approaching; it must be
either Martial or Nicholas."</p>

<p>At the mention of Martial's name, the features of
Amandine expressed a sort of troubled joy. After
waiting for some minutes, during which the anxious
looks of the impatient child were fixed on the door,
she saw, to her extreme regret, Nicholas, the future
accomplice of Barbillon, make his appearance. The
physiognomy of the youth was at once ignoble and
ferocious; small in figure, short in stature, and mean
in appearance, no one would have deemed him a likely
person to pursue the dangerous and criminal path he
trod. Unhappily, a sort of wild, savage energy supplied
the place of that physical force in which the hardened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
youth was deficient. Over his blue loose frock he wore
a kind of vest, without sleeves, made of goatskin,
covered with long brown hair. As he entered, he threw
on the ground a lump of copper, which he had with
difficulty carried on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"A famous good night I have made of it, mother!"
said he, in a hoarse and hollow voice, after he had freed
himself from his burden. "Look there! There's a
prize. Well, I've got three more lumps of copper,
quite as big as that, in my boat, a bundle of clothes,
and a case filled with something, I know not what,
for I did not waste my time in opening it. Perhaps
I have been robbed on my way home; we shall
see."</p>

<p>"And the man you were to meet on the Quai de
Billy?" inquired Calabash, while the widow regarded
her son in silence.</p>

<p>The only reply made by the young man consisted in
his plunging his hand into the pocket of his trousers,
and jingling a quantity of silver.</p>

<p>"Did you take all that from him?" cried Calabash.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't; he shelled out two hundred francs of
his own accord; and he will fork out eight hundred
more as soon as I have&mdash;But that's enough; let's,
first of all, unload my boat; we can jabber afterwards.
Is not Martial here?"</p>

<p>"No," said his sister.</p>

<p>"So much the better; we will put away the swag
before he sees it; leastways, if he can be kept from
knowing about it."</p>

<p>"What! Are you afraid of him, you coward?"
asked Calabash, provokingly.</p>

<p>Nicholas shrugged his shoulders significantly; then
replied:</p>

<p>"Afraid of him? No, I should rather think not!
But I have a strong suspicion he means to sell us,&mdash;that
is my only fear; as for any other sort of dread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
my weazen-slicer (knife) has rather too keen an edge
for that!"</p>

<p>"Ah, when he is not here, you are full of boast and
brag; but only let him show his face, and you are quiet
as a mouse!"</p>

<p>This reproach seemed quite thrown away upon
Nicholas, who, affecting not to have heard it,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come, come! Let's unload the boat at once.
Where is François, mother? He could help us a
good deal."</p>

<p>"Mother has locked him up, after having preciously
flogged him; and, I can tell you, he will have to go to
bed without any supper."</p>

<p>"Well and good as far as that goes; but still, he
might lend a hand in unloading the boat,&mdash;eh, mother?
Because, then myself and Calabash could fetch all in at
once."</p>

<p>The widow raised her hand, and pointed with her
finger towards the ceiling. Her daughter perfectly
comprehended the signal, and departed at once to
fetch François.</p>

<p>The countenance of the widow Martial had become
less cloudy since the arrival of Nicholas, whom she
greatly preferred to Calabash, but by no means entertaining
for him the affection she felt for her Toulon son,
as she designated him; for the maternal love of this
ferocious woman appeared to increase in proportion to
the criminality of her offspring. This perverse preference
will serve to account for the widow's indifference
towards her two younger children, neither of whom
exhibited any disposition to evil, as well as her perfect
hatred of Martial, her eldest son, who, although not
leading an altogether irreproachable life, might still
have passed for a perfectly honest and well-conducted
person if placed in comparison with Nicholas, Calabash,
or his brother, the felon at Toulon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which road did you take to-night?" inquired the
widow of her son.</p>

<p>"Why, as I returned from the Quai de Billy, where,
you know, I had to go to meet the gentleman who
appointed to see me there, I spied a barge moored alongside
the quay; it was as dark as pitch. 'Halloa!' says
I, 'no light in the cabin? No doubt,' says I, 'all hands
are ashore. I'll just go on board, and have a look; if I
meet any one, it's easy to ask for a bit of string, and
make up a fudge about wanting to splice my oar.' So
up the side I climbs, and ventures into the cabin. Not
a soul was there; so I began collecting all I could find:
clothes, a great box, and, on the deck, four quintals of
copper. So, you may guess, I was obliged to make two
journeys. The vessel was loaded with copper and iron;
but here comes François and Calabash. Now, then, let's
be off to the boat. Here, you young un, you Amandine!
Look sharp, and make yourself useful; you can carry
the clothes; we must get new things, you know, before
we can throw aside our old ones."</p>

<p>Left alone, the widow busied herself in preparations
for the family supper. She placed on the table bottles,
glasses, earthenware, plates, with forks and spoons of
silver; and, by the time this occupation was completed,
her offspring returned heavily laden.</p>

<p>Little François staggered beneath the weight of copper
which he carried on his shoulders, and Amandine was
almost buried beneath the mass of stolen garments which
she bore on her head, while Nicholas and Calabash
brought in between them a wooden case, on the top
of which lay the fourth lump of copper.</p>

<p>"The case,&mdash;the case!" cried Calabash, with savage
eagerness. "Come, let's rip it open, and know what's
in it."</p>

<p>The lumps of copper were flung on the ground.
Nicholas took the heavy hatchet he carried in his belt,
and introduced its strong iron head between the lid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the box which he had set down in the middle of the
kitchen, and endeavoured with all his strength to force
it open. The red and flickering light of the fire illumined
this scene of pillage, while, from without, the loud
gusts of the night wind increased in violence.</p>

<p>Nicholas, meanwhile, attired in his goatskin vest,
stooped over the box, and essayed with all his might
to wrench off the top, breaking out into the most
horrible and blasphemous expressions, as he found the
solidity of the fastenings resist all his endeavours to
arrive at a knowledge of its contents; and Calabash,
her eyes inflamed by covetousness, her cheeks flushed
by the excitement of plunder, knelt down beside the
case, on which she leaned her utmost weight, in order
to give more power to the action of the lever employed
by Nicholas. The widow, separated from the group by
the table, on the other side of which she was standing,
in her eagerness to behold the spoils, threw herself
almost across the table, the better to gaze on the booty;
her longing eyes sparkled with eagerness to learn the
value of it. And finally&mdash;though unhappily, too true
to human nature&mdash;the two children, whose naturally
good inclinations had so often triumphed over the sea
of vice and domestic corruption by which they were
surrounded, even they, forgetting at once both their
fears and their scruples, were alike infected by the
same fatal curiosity.</p>

<p>Huddling close to each other, their eyes glittering
with excitement, the breathing short and quick, François
and Amandine seemed of all the party most impatient
to ascertain the contents of the case, and the most
irritated and out of patience with the slow progress
made by Nicholas in his attempts to break it open. At
length the lid yielded to the powerful and repeated
blows dealt on it by the vigorous arm of the young
man, and as its fragments fell on the ground a loud,
exulting cry rose from the joyful and almost breathless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
group, who, joining in one wild mass, from the mother
to the little girl, rushed forward, and with savage
haste threw themselves on the opened box, which,
forwarded, doubtless, by some house in Paris to a
fashionable draper and mercer residing near the
banks of the river, contained a large assortment of
the different materials employed in female attire.</p>

<p>"Nicholas has not done amiss!" cried Calabash,
unfolding a piece of mousseline-de-laine.</p>

<p>"No, faith!" returned the plunderer, opening, in his
turn, a parcel of silk handkerchiefs; "I shall manage
to pay myself for my trouble."</p>

<p>"Levantine, I declare!" cried the widow, dipping
into the box, and drawing forth a rich silk. "Ah,
that is a thing that fetches a price as readily as a loaf
of bread."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bras Rouge's receiver, who lives in the Rue du
Temple, will buy all the finery, and be glad of it. And
Father Micou, the man who lets furnished lodgings in
the Quartier St. Honoré, will take the rest of the swag."</p>

<p>"Amandine," whispered François to his little sister,
"what a beautiful cravat one of those handsome silk
handkerchiefs Nicholas is holding in his hand would
make, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; and what a sweet pretty <i>marmotte</i> it would
make for me!" replied the child, in rapture at the
very idea.</p>

<p>"Well, it must be confessed, Nicholas," said Calabash,
"that it was a lucky thought of yours to go on board
that barge,&mdash;famous! Look, here are shawls, too!
How many, I wonder? One, two, three. And just
see here, mother! This one is real Bourre de Soie."</p>

<p>"Mother Burette would give at least five hundred
francs for the lot," said the widow, after closely examining

<p>"Then, I'll be sworn," answered Nicholas, "if she'll
give that, the things are worth at least fifteen hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
francs. But, as the old saying is, 'The receiver's as
bad as the thief.' Never mind; so much the worse for
us! I'm no hand at splitting differences; and I shall
be quite flat enough this time to let Mother Burette
have it all her own way, and Father Micou also, for
the matter of that; but then, to be sure, he is a friend."</p>

<p>"I don't care for that, he'd cheat you as soon as
another; I'm up to the old dealer in marine stores.
But then these rascally receivers know we cannot do
without them," continued Calabash, putting on one of
the shawls, and folding it around her, "and so they
take advantage of it."</p>

<p>"There is nothing else," said Nicholas, coming to the
bottom of the box.</p>

<p>"Now, let us put everything away," said the widow.</p>

<p>"I shall keep this shawl for myself," exclaimed Calabash.</p>

<p>"Oh, you will, will you?" cried Nicholas, roughly;
"that depends whether I choose to let you or not. You
are always laying your clutches on something or other;
you are Madame Free-and-Easy!"</p>

<p>"You are so mighty particular yourself&mdash;about taking
whatever you have a fancy to, arn't you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's as different as different can be! I filch
at the risk of my life; and if I had happened to have
been nabbed on board the barge, you would not have
been trounced for it."</p>

<p>"La! Well, don't make such a fuss,&mdash;take your shawl!
I'm sure I don't want it; I was only joking about it,"
continued Calabash, flinging the shawl back into the
box; "but you never can stand the least bit of fun."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't speak because of the shawl; I am not
stingy enough to squabble about a trumpery shawl. One
more or less would make no difference in the price
Mother Burette would give for the things; she buys in
the lump, you know," continued Nicholas; "only I consider
that, instead of calling out you should keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
shawl, it would have been more decent to have asked me
to give it you. There&mdash;there it is&mdash;keep it&mdash;you may
have it; keep it, I say, or else I'll just fling it into the
fire to make the pot boil."</p>

<p>These words entirely appeased Calabash, who forthwith
accepted the shawl without further scruple.</p>

<p>Nicholas appeared seized with a sudden fit of generosity,
for, ripping off the fag end from one of the pieces
of silk, he contrived to separate two silk handkerchiefs,
which he threw to Amandine and François, who had
been contemplating them with longing looks, saying:</p>

<p>"There! that's for you brats; just a little taste to
give you a relish for prigging; it's a thing you'll take
to more kindly if it's made agreeable to you. And now,
get off to bed. Come, look sharp, I've got a deal to say
to mother. There&mdash;you shall have some supper brought
up-stairs to you."</p>

<p>The delighted children clapped their hands with joy,
and triumphantly waved the stolen handkerchiefs which
had just been presented to them.</p>

<p>"What do you say now, you little stupids?" said
Calabash to them; "will you ever go and be persuaded
by Martial again? Did he ever give you beautiful silk
handkerchiefs like those, I should be glad to know?"</p>

<p>François and Amandine looked at each other, then
hung down their heads, and made no answer.</p>

<p>"Answer, can't you?" persisted Calabash, roughly.
"I ask you whether you ever received such presents
from Martial?"</p>

<p>"No," answered François, gazing with intense delight
on his bright red silk handkerchief, "Brother Martial
never gives us anything."</p>

<p>To which Amandine replied, in a low yet firm voice:</p>

<p>"Ah, François, that is because Martial has nothing to
give anybody."</p>

<p>"He might have as much as other people if he chose to
steal it, mightn't he, François?" said Nicholas, brutally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, brother," replied François. Then, as if glad
to quit the subject, he resumed his ecstatic contemplation
of his handkerchief, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, what a real beauty it is! What a fine cravat it
will make for Sundays, won't it?"</p>

<p>"That it will," answered Amandine. "And just see,
François, how charming I shall look with my sweet
pretty handkerchief tied around my head,&mdash;so, brother."</p>

<p>"What a rage the little children at the lime-kilns will
be in when they see you pass by!" said Calabash, fixing
her malignant glances on the poor children to ascertain
whether they comprehended the full and spiteful meaning
of her words,&mdash;the hateful creature seeking, by the
aid of vanity, to stifle the last breathings of virtue
within their young minds. "The brats at the lime-kilns,"
continued she, "will look like beggar children
beside you, and be ready to burst with envy and jealousy
at seeing you two looking like a little lady and gentleman
with your pretty silk handkerchiefs."</p>

<p>"So they will," cried François. "Ah, and I like my
new cravat ever so much the better, Sister Calabash,
now you have told me that the children at the kilns will
be so mad with me for being smarter than they; don't
you, Amandine?"</p>

<p>"No, François, I don't find that makes any difference.
But I am quite glad I have got such a nice new pretty
<i>marmotte</i> as that will make, all the same."</p>

<p>"Go along with you, you little mean-spirited thing!"
cried Calabash, disdainfully; "you have not a grain of
proper pride in you." Then, snatching from the table a
morsel of bread and cheese, she thrust them into the
children's hands, saying, "Now, get off to bed,&mdash;there
is a lanthorn; take care you don't set fire to anything,
and be sure to put it out before you go to sleep."</p>

<p>"And hark ye," added Nicholas, "remember that if
you dare to say one word to Martial of the box, the copper,
or the clothes, I'll make you dance upon red-hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
iron; and, besides that, your pretty silk handkerchiefs
shall be taken from you."</p>

<p>After the departure of the children, Nicholas and
his sister concealed the box, with its contents, the
clothes, and lumps of copper, in a sort of cellar below
the kitchen, the entrance to which was by a low flight of
steps not far from the fireplace.</p>

<p>"That'll do!" cried the hardened youth. "And now,
mother, give us a glass of your very best brandy; none
of your poor, every-day stuff, but some of the real right
sort, and plenty of it. Faith! I think I've earned a
right to eat and to drink whatever you happen to have
put by for grand occasions. Come, Calabash, look sharp,
and let's have supper. Never mind Martial, he may
amuse himself with picking the bones we may leave;
they are good enough for him. Now, then, for a bit of
gossip over the affair of the individual I went to meet
on the Quai de Billy, because that little job must be
settled at once if I mean to pouch the money he promised
me. I'll tell you all about it, mother, from beginning
to end. But first give me something to moisten
my throat. Give me some drink, I say! Devilish hard
to be obliged to ask so many times, considering what I
have done for you all to-day! I tell you I can stand
treat, if that's what you are waiting for."</p>

<p>And here Nicholas again jingled the five-franc pieces
he had in his pocket; then flinging his goatskin waistcoat
and black woollen cap into a distant part of the
room, he seated himself at table before a huge dish of
ragout made of mutton, a piece of cold veal, and a salad.
As soon as Calabash had brought wine and brandy, the
widow, still gloomy and imperturbable, took her place at
one side of the table, having Nicholas on her right hand
and her daughter on her left; the other side of the table
had been destined for Martial and the two younger children.
Nicholas then drew from his pocket a long and
wide Spanish knife, with a horn handle and a trenchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
blade. Contemplating this murderous weapon with a
sort of savage pleasure, he said to the widow:</p>

<p>"There's my bread-earner,&mdash;what an edge it has!
Talking of bread, mother, just hand me some of that
beside you."</p>

<p>"And talking of knives, too," replied Calabash,
"François has found out&mdash;you know what&mdash;in the
wood-pile!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Nicholas, not understanding
her.</p>

<p>"Why, he saw&mdash;one of the feet!"</p>

<p>"Phew!" whistled Nicholas; "what, of the man?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the widow, concisely, at the same
time placing a large slice of meat on her son's plate.</p>

<p>"That's droll enough," returned the young ruffian;
"I'm sure the hole was dug deep enough; but I suppose
the ground has sunk in a good deal."</p>

<p>"It must all be thrown into the river to-night," said
the widow.</p>

<p>"That is the surest way to get rid of further bother,"
said Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Yes," chimed in Calabash, "throw it in the river,
with a heavy stone fastened to it, with part of an old
boat-chain."</p>

<p>"We are not quite such fools as that either," returned
Nicholas, pouring out for himself a brimming glass of
wine. Then, holding the bottle up, he said, addressing
the widow: "Come, mother, let's touch glasses, and
drink to each other. You seem a cup too low, and it
will cheer you up."</p>

<p>The widow drew back her glass, shook her head, and
said to her son:</p>

<p>"Tell me of the man you met on the Quai de Billy."</p>

<p>"Why, this is it," said Nicholas, without ceasing to
eat and drink: "When I got to the landing-place, I fastened
my boat, and went up the steps of the quay as the
clock was striking seven at the military bakehouse at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Chaillot. You could not see four yards before you, but
I walked up and down by the parapet wall for a quarter
of an hour, when I heard footsteps moving softly behind
me. I stopped, and a man, completely wrapped up in a
mantle, approached me, coughing as he advanced. As I
paused, he paused; and all I could make out of him was
that his cloak hid his nose, and his hat fell over his
eyes."</p>

<p>We will inform our readers that this mysterious personage
was Jacques Ferrand, the notary, who, anxious
to get rid of Fleur-de-Marie, had, that same morning,
despatched Madame Séraphin to the Martials, whom
he hoped to find the ready instruments of his fresh
crime.</p>

<p>"'Bradamanti,' said the man to me," continued
Nicholas; "that was the password agreed upon by the
old woman, that I might know my man. 'Ravageur,'
says I, as was agreed. 'Is your name Martial?' he
asked. 'Yes, master.' 'A woman was at your isle to-day:
what did she say to you?' 'That you wished to
speak to me on the part of M. Bradamanti.' 'You have
a boat?' 'We have four, that's our number: boatmen
and ravageurs, from father to son, at your service.'
'This is what I want you to do if you are not
afraid&mdash;' 'Afraid of what, master?' 'Of seeing a
person accidentally drowned. Only you must assist with
the accident. Do you understand?' 'Perfectly, master;
we must make some individual have a draught of
the Seine, as if by accident? I'll do it; only, as the
dish to be dressed is a dainty one, why, the seasoning
will cost rather dear.' 'How much for two?' 'For
two? What! are there two persons who are to have a
mess of broth in the river?' 'Yes.' 'Five hundred
francs a head, master; that's not too dear.' 'Agreed,
for a thousand francs.' 'Money down, master?' 'Two
hundred francs now, and the rest afterwards.' 'Then
you doubt me, master?' 'No; you may pocket the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
hundred francs, without completing the bargain.' 'And
you may say, after it's done, "Don't you wish you may
get it?"' 'That as may be; but does it suit you? yes
or no. Two hundred francs down, and on the evening
of the day after to-morrow, here, at nine o'clock, I will
give you the eight hundred francs.' 'And who will inform
you that I have done the trick with these two persons?'
'I shall know; that is my affair. Is it a
bargain?' 'Yes, master.' 'Here are two hundred
francs. Now listen to me; you will know again the old
woman who was at your house this morning?' 'Yes,
master.' 'To-morrow, or next day at latest, you will
see her come, about four o'clock in the evening, on the
bank in face of your island with a young fair girl. The
old woman will make a signal to you by waving her
handkerchief.' 'Yes, master.' 'What time does it take
to go from the bank-side to your island?' 'Twenty
minutes, quite.' 'Your boats are flat-bottomed?' 'Flat
as your hand, master.' 'Then you must make, very
skilfully, a sort of large hole in the bottom of one of
these boats, so that, when you open it, the water may
flow in rapidly. Do you understand?' 'Quite well,
master; how clever you are! I have by me a worn-out
old boat, half rotten, that I was going to break up, but
it will just do for this one more voyage.' 'You will then
leave the island with this boat, with the hole prepared;
let a good boat follow you, conducted by some one of
your family. Go to the shore, accost the old woman
and the fair young girl, and take them on board the
boat with the hole in it; then go back towards your
island; but, when you are at some distance from the
bank, pretend to stoop for some purpose, open the hole,
and leap into the other boat, whilst the old woman and
the fair young girl&mdash;' 'Drink out of the same cup,&mdash;that's
it,&mdash;eh, master?' 'But are you sure you will
not be interrupted? Suppose some customers should
come to your house?' 'There is no fear, master. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
this time, and especially in winter, no one comes, it is
our dead time of year; and, if they come, that would
not be troublesome; on the contrary, they are all good
friends.' 'Very well. Besides, you in no way compromise
yourselves; the boat will be supposed to have
sunk from old age, and the old woman who brings the
young girl will disappear with her. In order to be quite
assured that they are drowned (by accident, mind! quite
by accident), you can, if they rise to the surface, or if
they cling to the boat, appear to do all in your power to
assist them, and&mdash;' 'Help them&mdash;to sink again!
Good, master!' 'It will be requisite that the passage
be made after sunset, in order that it may be quite dark
when they fall into the water.' 'No, master; for if one
does not see clear, how shall we know if the two women
swallow their doses at one gulp, or want a second?'
'True; and, therefore, the accident will take place before
sunset.' 'All right, master; but the old woman has
no suspicion, has she?' 'Not the slightest. When she
arrives, she will whisper to you: "The young girl is to
be drowned; a little while before you sink the boat,
make me a signal, that I may be ready to escape with
you." You will reply to the old woman in such a way as
to avoid all suspicion.' 'So that she may suppose the
young 'un only is going to swallow the dose?' 'But
which she will drink as well as the fair girl.' 'It's
"downily" arranged, master.' 'But mind the old
woman has not the slightest suspicion.' 'Be easy on
that score, master; she will be done as nicely as possible.'
'Well, then, good luck to you, my lad! If I am
satisfied, perhaps I shall give you another job.' 'At
your service, master.' Then," said the ruffian, in conclusion,
"I left the man in the cloak, and 'prigged the
swag' I've just brought in."</p>

<p>We may glean from Nicholas's recital that the notary
was desirous, by a twofold crime, of getting rid at once
of Fleur-de-Marie and Madame Séraphin, by causing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
latter to fall into the snare which she thought was only
spread for the Goualeuse. It is hardly necessary to repeat
that, justly alarmed lest the Chouette should inform
Fleur-de-Marie at any moment that she had been abandoned
by Madame Séraphin, Jacques Ferrand believed he
had a paramount interest in getting rid of this young
girl, whose claims might mortally injure him both in his
fortune and in his reputation. As to Madame Séraphin,
the notary, by sacrificing her, got rid of one of his accomplices
(Bradamanti was the other), who might ruin
him, whilst they ruined themselves, it is true; but
Jacques Ferrand believed that the grave would keep
his secrets better than any personal interests.</p>

<p>The felon's widow and Calabash had listened attentively
to Nicholas, who had not paused except to swallow
large quantities of wine, and then he began to talk with
considerable excitement.</p>

<p>"That is not all," he continued. "I have begun
another affair with the Chouette and Barbillon of the
Rue aux Fêves. It is a capital job, well planted; and if
it does not miss fire, it will bring plenty of fish to net,
and no mistake. It is to clean out a jewel-matcher,
who has sometimes as much as fifty thousand francs in
jewelry in her basket."</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand francs!" cried the mother and
daughter, whose eyes sparkled with cupidity.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;quite. Bras Rouge is in it with us. He
yesterday opened upon the woman with a letter which
we carried to her&mdash;Barbillon and I&mdash;at her house,
Boulevard St. Denis. He's an out-and-outer, Bras Rouge
is! As he appears&mdash;and, I believe, is&mdash;well-to-do,
nobody mistrusts him. To make the jewel-matcher
bite he has already sold her a diamond worth four
hundred francs. She'll not be afraid to come towards
nightfall to his cabaret in the Champs Elysées. We
shall be concealed there. Calabash may come with us,
and take care of my boat along the side of the Seine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
If we are obliged to carry her off, dead or alive, that
will be a convenient conveyance, and one that leaves no
traces. There's a plan for you! That beggar Bras
Rouge is nothing but a good 'un!"</p>

<p>"I have always distrusted Bras Rouge," said the
widow. "After that affair of the Rue Montmartre
your brother Ambroise was sent to Toulon, and Bras
Rouge was set at liberty."</p>

<p>"Because he's so downy there's no proofs against
him. But betray others?&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>The widow shook her head, as if she were only
half convinced of Bras Rouge's probity. After a few
moments' reflection she said:</p>

<p>"I like much better that affair of the Quai de Billy
for to-morrow or next day evening,&mdash;the drowning the
two women. But Martial will be in the way as usual."</p>

<p>"Will not the devil's thunder ever rid us of him?"
exclaimed Nicholas, half drunk, and striking his long
knife savagely on the table.</p>

<p>"I have told mother that we had enough of him, and
that we could not go on in this way," said Calabash.
"As long as he is here we can do nothing with the
children."</p>

<p>"I tell you that he is capable of one day denouncing
us,&mdash;the villain!" said Nicholas. "You see, mother, if
you would have believed me," he added, with a savage
and significant air, "all would have been settled!"</p>

<p>"There are other means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is the best!" said the ruffian.</p>

<p>"Now? No!" replied the widow, with a tone so
decided that Nicholas was silent, overcome by the influence
of his mother, whom he knew to be as criminal, as
wicked, but still more determined than himself.</p>

<p>The widow added, "To-morrow he will quit the island
for ever."</p>

<p>"How?" inquired Nicholas and Calabash at the same
time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"When he comes in pick a quarrel with him,&mdash;but
boldly, mind,&mdash;out to his face, as you have never yet
dared to do. Come to blows, if necessary. He is
powerful, but you will be two, for I will help you.
Mind, no steel,&mdash;no blood! Let him be beaten, but
not wounded."</p>

<p>"And what then, mother?" asked Nicholas.</p>

<p>"We shall then explain afterwards. We will tell
him to leave the island next day; if not, that the
scenes of the night before will occur over and over
again. I know him; these perpetual squabbles disgust
him; until now we have let him be too quiet."</p>

<p>"But he is as obstinate as a mule, and is likely
enough to insist upon staying, because of the children,"
observed Calabash.</p>

<p>"He's a regular hound; but a row don't frighten
him," said Nicholas.</p>

<p>"One? No!" said the widow. "But every day&mdash;day
by day&mdash;it is hell in earth, and he will give way."</p>

<p>"Suppose he don't?"</p>

<p>"Then I have another sure means to make him go
away,&mdash;this very night or to-morrow at farthest,"
replied the widow, with a singular smile.</p>

<p>"Really, mother!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I prefer rather to annoy him with a row;
and, if that don't do, why, then, it must be the other
way."</p>

<p>"And if the other way does not succeed, either,
mother?" said Nicholas.</p>

<p>"There is one which always succeeds," replied the
widow.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, and Martial entered. It
blew so strong without that they had not heard the
barkings of the dogs at the return of the first-born
son of the felon's widow.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h5>THE MOTHER AND SON.</h5>


<p>Unaware of the evil designs of his family, Martial
entered the kitchen slowly.</p>

<p>Some few words let fall by La Louve in her conversation
with Fleur-de-Marie have already acquainted
the reader with the singular existence of this man.
Endowed with excellent natural instincts, incapable
of an action positively base or wicked, Martial did not,
however, lead a regular life: he poached on the water;
but his strength and his boldness inspired so much fear
that the keepers of the river shut their eyes on this
irregularity.</p>

<p>To this illegal occupation Martial joined another that
was equally illicit. A redoubtable champion, he willingly
undertook&mdash;and more from excess of courage,
from love of the thing, than for gain&mdash;to avenge in
pugilistic or single-stick encounters those victims who
had been overcome by too powerful opponents.</p>

<p>We should add that Martial was very particular in
the selection of those causes which he pleaded by
strength of fist, and usually took the part of the weak
against the strong.</p>

<p>La Louve's lover was very much like François and
Amandine. He was of middle height, stout, and broad-shouldered;
his thick red hair, cropped short, came in
five points over his open brow; his close, harsh, short
beard, his broad, bluff cheeks, his projecting nose, flattened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
at the extremity, his blue and bold eyes, gave to
his masculine features a singularly resolute expression.</p>

<p>He was covered with an old glazed hat; and, despite
the cold, he had only a worn-out blouse over his vest,
and a pair of velveteen trousers, which had seen considerable
service. He held in his hand a very thick,
knotted stick, which he put down beside him near the
dresser.</p>

<p>A large dog, half terrier, half hound, with crooked
legs and a black hide, marked with bright red, came in
with Martial, but he remained close to the door, not
daring to approach the fire, nor the guests who were
sitting at table, experience having proved to old Miraut
(that was the name of Martial's poaching companion)
that he, as well as his master, did not possess much of
the sympathy of the family.</p>

<p>"Where are the children?" were Martial's first
words, as he sat down to table.</p>

<p>"Where they ought to be," replied Calabash, surlily.</p>

<p>"Where are the children, mother?" said Martial
again, without taking the slightest notice of his sister's
reply.</p>

<p>"Gone to bed," replied the widow, in a harsh tone.</p>

<p>"Haven't they had their supper, mother?"</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" exclaimed Nicholas, brutally,
after having swallowed a large glass of wine to increase
his courage, for his brother's disposition and strength
had a very strong effect on him.</p>

<p>Martial, as indifferent to the attacks of Nicholas as to
those of Calabash, then said to his mother, "I'm sorry
the children are gone to bed so soon."</p>

<p>"So much the worse," responded the widow.</p>

<p>"Yes, so much the worse; for I like to have them
beside me when I am at supper."</p>

<p>"And we, because they were troublesome and
annoyed us, have sent them off," cried Nicholas;
"and if you don't like it, why, you can go after them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Martial, astonished, looked steadfastly at his brother.
Then, as if convinced of the futility of a quarrel, he
shrugged his shoulders, cut off a slice of bread and a
piece of meat.</p>

<p>The dog had come up towards Nicholas, although
keeping at a very respectful distance; and the ruffian,
irritated at the disdain with which his brother treated
him, and hoping to wear out his patience by ill-using
his dog, gave Miraut a savage kick, which made the
poor brute howl fearfully. Martial turned red, clasped
in his hand the knife he held, and struck violently
on the table with the handle; but, again controlling
himself, he called the dog to him, saying, quietly, "Here,
Miraut!" The hound came, and crouched at his master's
feet.</p>

<p>This composure quite upset Nicholas's plans, who was
desirous of pushing his brother to extremities, in order
to produce an explosion. So he added, "I hate dogs&mdash;I
do; and I won't have this dog remain here." Martial's
only reply was to pour out a glass of wine, and drink it
off slowly. Exchanging a rapid glance with Nicholas,
the widow encouraged him by a signal to continue his
hostilities towards Martial, hoping, as we have said, that
a violent quarrel would arise that would lead to a rupture
and complete separation.</p>

<p>Nicholas, then, taking up the willow stick which the
widow had used to beat François, went up to the dog,
and, striking him sharply, said, "Get out, you brute,
Miraut!"</p>

<p>Up to this time Nicholas had often shown himself
sulkily offensive towards Martial, but he had never
dared to provoke him with so much audacity and
perseverance. La Louve's lover, thinking they were
desirous of driving him to extremities for some secret
motive, quelled every impulse of temper.</p>

<p>At the cry of the beaten dog, Martial rose, opened the
door of the kitchen, made the dog go out, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
returned, and went on with his supper. This incredible
patience, so little in harmony with Martial's usual demeanour,
puzzled and nonplussed his aggressors, who
looked at each other with amazement. He, affecting to
appear wholly unconscious of what was passing around
him, ate away with great appetite, keeping profound
silence.</p>

<p>"Calabash, take the wine away," said the widow to
her daughter.</p>

<p>She hastened to comply, when Martial said, "Stay, I
haven't done my supper."</p>

<p>"So much the worse," said the widow, taking the
bottle away herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's another thing!" answered La Louve's
lover. And pouring out a large glass of water, he
drank it, smacking his tongue, and exclaiming, "Capital
water!"</p>

<p>This excessive calmness irritated the burning anger
of Nicholas, already heated by copious libations; but
still he hesitated at making a direct attack, well knowing
the vast power of his brother. Suddenly he cried
out, as if delighted at the idea, "Martial, you were quite
right to turn the dog out. It is a good habit to begin to
give way, for you have but to wait a bit, and you will
see us kick your sweetheart out just as we have driven
away your dog."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; for if La Louve is impudent enough to
come to the island when she leaves gaol," added Calabash,
who quite understood Nicholas's motive, "I'll
serve her out."</p>

<p>"And I'll give her a dip in the mud by the hovel at
the end of the island," continued Nicholas; "and, if she
gets out, I'll give her a few rattlers over the nob with
my wooden shoe, the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This insult addressed to La Louve, whom he loved
with savage ardour, triumphed over the pacific resolutions
of Martial; he frowned, and the blood mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to his cheeks, whilst the veins in his brow swelled and
distended like cords. Still, he had so much control over
himself as to say to Nicholas, in a voice slightly altered
by his repressed wrath:</p>

<p>"Take care of yourself! You are trying to pick a
quarrel, and you will find a bone to pick that will be
too tough for you."</p>

<p>"A bone for me to pick?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I'll thrash you more soundly than I did
last time."</p>

<p>"What! Nicholas," said Calabash, with a sardonic
grin, "did Martial thrash you? Did you hear that,
mother? I'm not astonished that Nicholas is so afraid
of him."</p>

<p>"He walloped me, because, like a coward, he took me off
my guard," exclaimed Nicholas, turning pale with rage.</p>

<p>"You lie! You attacked me unexpectedly; I knocked
you flat, and then showed you mercy. But if you talk
of my mistress,&mdash;I say, mind you, of my mistress,&mdash;this
time I look it over,&mdash;you shall carry my marks for
many a long day."</p>

<p>"And suppose I choose to talk of La Louve?"
inquired Calabash.</p>

<p>"Why, I'll pull your ears to put you on your guard;
and if you begin again, why, so will I."</p>

<p>"And suppose I speak of her?" said the widow,
slowly.</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;I!"</p>

<p>"You?" said Martial, making a violent effort over
himself; "you?"</p>

<p>"You'll beat me, too, I suppose,&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>"No; but, if you speak to me unkindly of La Louve,
I'll give Nicholas a hiding he shall long remember. So
now, mind! It is his affair as well as yours."</p>

<p>"You?" exclaimed the ruffian, rising, and drawing
his dangerous Spanish knife; "you give me a hiding?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nicholas, no steel!" cried the widow, quickly, leaving
her seat, and trying to seize her son's arm; but
he, drunk with wine and passion, repulsed his mother
savagely, and rushed at his brother.</p>

<p>Martial receded rapidly, laid hold of the thick,
knotted stick which he had put down by the dresser,
as he entered, and betook himself to the defensive.</p>

<p>"Nicholas, no steel!" repeated the widow.</p>

<p>"Let him alone!" cried Calabash, taking up the
ravageur's hatchet.</p>

<p>Nicholas, still brandishing his formidable knife,
watched for a moment when he could spring on his
brother.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he exclaimed, "you and your trollop,
La Louve, that I'll slash your eyes out; and here goes
to begin! Help, mother! Help, Calabash! Let's make
cold meat of the scamp; he's been in our way too long
already!" And, believing the moment favourable for
his attack, the brigand dashed at his brother with his
uplifted knife.</p>

<p>Martial, who was a dexterous cudgeller, retreated a
pace rapidly, raising his stick, which, as quick as lightning,
cut a figure of eight, and fell so heavily on the right
forearm of Nicholas that he, seized with a sudden and
overpowering pain, dropped his trenchant weapon.</p>

<p>"Villain, you have broken my arm!" he shouted,
grasping with his left hand the right arm, which hung
useless by his side.</p>

<p>"No; for I felt my stick rebound!" replied Martial,
kicking, as he spoke, the knife underneath the dresser.</p>

<p>Then, taking advantage of the pain which Nicholas
was suffering, he seized him by the collar, and thrust
him violently backwards, until he had reached the door
of the little cellar we have alluded to, which he opened
with one hand, whilst, with the other, he thrust his
brother into it, and locked him in, all stupefied as he
was with this sudden attack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, turning round upon the two women, he seized
Calabash by the shoulders, and, in spite of her resistance,
her shrieks, and a blow from the hatchet, which cut his
head slightly, he shut her up in the lower room of the
cabaret, which communicated with the kitchen.</p>

<p>Then addressing the widow, who was still stupefied
with this man&oelig;uvre, as skilful as it was sudden, Martial
said to her, calmly, "Now, mother, you and I are alone."</p>

<p>"Yes, we are alone," replied the widow, and her
usually immobile features became excited, her sallow
skin grew red, a gloomy fire lighted up her dull eye,
whilst anger and hate gave to her countenance a terrible
expression. "Yes, we two are alone now!" she repeated,
in a menacing voice. "I have waited for this moment;
and at length you shall know all that I have on my
mind."</p>

<p>"And I will tell you all I have on my mind."</p>

<p>"If you live to be a hundred years old, I tell you you
shall remember this night."</p>

<p>"I shall remember it, unquestionably. My brother
and sister have tried to murder me, and you have done
nothing to prevent them. But come, let me hear what
you have against me?"</p>

<p>"What have I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Since your father's death you have acted nothing
but a coward's part."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a coward's! Instead of remaining with us to
support us, you went off to Rambouillet, to poach in the
woods with that man who sells game whom you knew
at Bercy."</p>

<p>"If I had remained here, I should have been at the
galleys like Ambroise, or on the point of going there
like Nicholas. I would not be a robber like the rest,
and that is the cause of your hatred."</p>

<p>"And what track are you following now? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
steal game, you steal fish,&mdash;thefts without danger,&mdash;a
coward's thefts!"</p>

<p>"Fish, like game, is no man's property. To-day
belongs to one, to-morrow to another. It is his who
can take it. I don't steal. As to being a coward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you fight&mdash;and for money&mdash;men who are
weaker than yourself."</p>

<p>"Because they have beaten men weaker than themselves."</p>

<p>"A coward's trade,&mdash;a coward's trade!"</p>

<p>"Why, there are more honest pursuits, it is true.
But it is not for you to tell me this!"</p>

<p>"Then why did you not take up with those honest
trades, instead of coming here skulking and feeding out
of my saucepans?"</p>

<p>"I give you the fish I catch, and what money I have.
It isn't much, but it's enough; and I don't cost you anything.
I have tried to be a locksmith to earn more; but
when one has from one's infancy led a vagabond life on
the river and in the woods, it is impossible to confine
oneself to one spot. It is a settled thing, and one's life
is decided. And then," added Martial, with a gloomy
air, "I have always preferred living alone on the water
or in the forest. There no one questions me; whilst
elsewhere men twit me about my father, who was (can
I deny it?) guillotined,&mdash;of my brother, a galley-slave,&mdash;of
my sister, a thief!"</p>

<p>"And what do you say of your mother?"</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I say she is dead."</p>

<p>"You do right; it is as if I were, for I renounce you,
dastard! Your brother is at the galleys; your grandfather
and your father finished their lives daringly on
the scaffold, mocking the priest and the executioner!
Instead of avenging them you tremble!"</p>

<p>"Avenging them?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, by showing yourself a real Martial, spitting at
the headsman's knife and the red cassock, and ending
like father, mother, brother, sister&mdash;"</p>

<p>Accustomed as he was to the savage excitement of
his mother, Martial could not forbear shuddering. The
countenance of the widow as she uttered the last
words was fearful. She continued, with increasing
wrath:</p>

<p>"Oh, coward! and even worse than coward! You
wish to be honest! Honest? Why, won't you ever
be despised, repulsed, as the son of an assassin or the
brother of a felon? But you, instead of rousing your
revenge and wrath, this makes you frightened! Instead
of biting, you run away! When they guillotined your
father, you left us,&mdash;coward! And you knew we could
not leave the island to go into the city, because they call
after us, and pelt us with stones, like mad dogs. Oh,
they shall pay for it, I can tell you,&mdash;they shall pay
for it!"</p>

<p>"A man?&mdash;ten men would not make me afraid!
But to be called after by all the world as the son and
brother of criminals! Well, I could not endure it. I
preferred going into the woods and poaching with Pierre,
who sells game."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you remain in the woods?"</p>

<p>"I returned because I got into trouble with a keeper,
and besides on the children's account, because they are
of an age to take to evil from example."</p>

<p>"And what is that to you?"</p>

<p>"To me? Why, I will not allow them to become
depraved like Ambroise, Nicholas, and Calabash."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"And if they were left with you, then they would not
fail to become so. I went apprentice to try and gain a
livelihood, so that I might take them into my own care
and leave the island with the children; but in Paris
everything was known, and it was always, 'You son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the guillotined!' or, 'You brother of the felon!' I had
battles daily, and I grew tired of it."</p>

<p>"But you didn't grow tired of being honest,&mdash;that
answered so well! Instead of having the pluck to come
to us, and do as we do,&mdash;as the children will do, in
spite of you,&mdash;yes, in spite of you! You think to
cajole them with your preaching! But we are always
here. François is already one of us, or nearly. Let
the occasion serve, and he'll be one of the band."</p>

<p>"I tell you, no!"</p>

<p>"You will see,&mdash;yes! I know what I say. He has
vice in him; but you spoil him. As to Amandine, as
soon as she is fifteen she will begin on her own account!
Ah, they throw stones at us! Ah, they pursue us like
mad dogs! They shall see what our family is made of!
Except you, dastard; for here you are the only one who
brings down shame upon us!"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> These frightful facts are, unfortunately, not exaggerated. The following
is from the admirable report of M. de Bretignères on the Penitentiary
Colony of Mettray (March 12, 1843):
</p><p>
"The civil condition of our colonists it is important to state. Amongst
them we count thirty-two natural children; thirty-four whose fathers and
mothers are re-married; fifty-one whose parents are in prison; 124 whose
parents have not been pursued by justice, but are in the utmost distress.
These figures are eloquent, and full of instruction. They allow us to go
from effects to causes, and give us the hope of arresting the progress of an
evil whose origin is thus arrived at. The number of parents who are criminals
enable us to appreciate the education which the children have received
under the tutelage of such instructors. Taught evil by their fathers, the
sons have become wicked by their orders, and have believed they were acting
properly in following their example. Arrested by the hand of the law, they
resign themselves to share the destiny of their family in prison, to which
they only bring the emulation of vice; and it is absolutely necessary that a
ray of divine light should still exist within these rude and coarse natures, in
order that all the germs of honesty should not be utterly destroyed."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"That's a pity!"</p>

<p>"And as you may be spoiled amongst us, why, to-morrow
you shall leave this place, and never return to it."</p>

<p>Martial looked at his mother with surprise, then, after
a moment's silence, said, "Was it for this that you tried
to get up a quarrel with me at supper?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to show you what you might expect if you
would stay here in spite of us,&mdash;a hell upon earth,&mdash;I
tell you, a hell! Every day a quarrel and blows&mdash;struggles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
And we shall not be alone as we were this,
evening; we shall have friends who will help us. And
you will not hold out for a week."</p>

<p>"Do you think to frighten me?"</p>

<p>"I only tell you what will happen."</p>

<p>"I don't heed it. I shall stay!"</p>

<p>"You will stay?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In spite of us?"</p>

<p>"In spite of you, of Calabash, of Nicholas, and all
blackguards like him."</p>

<p>"Really, you make me laugh."</p>

<p>From the lips of this woman, with her repulsive and
ferocious look, these words were horrible.</p>

<p>"I tell you I will remain here until I find the means
of gaining my livelihood elsewhere with the children.
Alone, I should not long be unemployed, for I could
return to the woods; but, on their account, I may be
some time in finding what I am seeking for. In the
meanwhile, here I remain."</p>

<p>"Oh, you remain until the moment when you can
take away the children?"</p>

<p>"Exactly as you say."</p>

<p>"Take away the children?"</p>

<p>"When I say to them 'Come!' they will come; and
quickly too, I promise you."</p>

<p>The widow shrugged her shoulders, and replied:</p>

<p>"Listen! I told you a short time since that, even if
you were to live for a hundred years, you should recollect
this night. I will explain those words. But, before
I do so, have you quite made up your mind?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! Yes! A thousand times over, yes!"</p>

<p>"In a little while, however, you will say 'No! No!
No! A thousand times, no!' Listen to me attentively!
Do you know the trade your brother follows?"</p>

<p>"I have my suspicions; but I do not wish to know."</p>

<p>"You shall know. He steals!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"So much the worse for him!"</p>

<p>"And for you!"</p>

<p>"For me?"</p>

<p>"He commits robberies at night, with forcible entry,&mdash;burglary;
a case of the galleys. We receive what
he plunders. If we are discovered, we shall be sentenced
to the same punishment as he is, as receivers,
and you too. They will sweep away the whole family,
and the children will be turned out into the streets,
where they will learn the trade of their father and
grandfather as well as here."</p>

<p>"I apprehended as a receiver,&mdash;as your accomplice?
Where's the proofs?"</p>

<p>"No one knows how you live. You are vagabondising
on the water; you have the reputation of a bad
fellow; you dwell with us, and who will believe that
you are ignorant of our thefts and receivings?"</p>

<p>"I will prove the contrary."</p>

<p>"We will accuse you as our accomplice."</p>

<p>"Accuse me! And why?"</p>

<p>"To pay you off for staying amongst us against our
will."</p>

<p>"Just now you tried to make me frightened in one
way, now you are trying another tack. But it won't
do. I will prove that I never robbed. I remain."</p>

<p>"Ah! You remain? Listen then, again! Do you
remember last year a person who passed the Christmas
night here?"</p>

<p>"Christmas night?" said Martial, trying to recall his
memory.</p>

<p>"Try and remember,&mdash;try!"</p>

<p>"I do not recollect."</p>

<p>"Don't you recollect that Bras Rouge brought here
in the evening a well-dressed man, who was desirous of
concealing himself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, now I remember. I went up to bed and left
him taking his supper with you. He passed the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
here, and, before daybreak, Nicholas took him to St.
Ouen."</p>

<p>"You are sure Nicholas took him to St. Ouen?"</p>

<p>"You told me so next morning."</p>

<p>"On Christmas night you were here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and what of that?"</p>

<p>"Why, that night this man, who had a good deal of
money about him, was murdered in this house."</p>

<p>"Mur&mdash;! He! Here?"</p>

<p>"And robbed and buried by the little wood-pile."</p>

<p>"It is not true!" cried Martial, becoming pale with
horror, and unable to believe in this fresh crime of his
family. "You mean to frighten me. Once more, it is
not true?"</p>

<p>"Ask François what he saw this morning in the
wood-pile."</p>

<p>"François! And what did he see?"</p>

<p>"A man's foot sticking out of the ground. Take a
lantern; go and convince your eyes!"</p>

<p>"No," said Martial, wiping his brow, which had burst
forth in a cold sweat. "No, I do not believe you. You
say it to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To prove to you that, if you remain here in spite
of us, you risk every moment being apprehended as an
accomplice in robbery and murder. You were here on
Christmas night, and we shall declare that you helped us
to do this job. How will you prove the contrary?"</p>

<p>"Merciless wretch!" said Martial, hiding his face in
his hands.</p>

<p>"Now will you go?" said the widow, with a devilish
smile.</p>

<p>Martial was overwhelmed. He, unfortunately, could
not doubt what his mother had said to him. The wandering
life he led, his dwelling with so criminal a
family, must induce the most horrible suspicions of
him, and these suspicions would be converted into certainty
in the eyes of justice, if his mother, brother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
sister declared him to be their accomplice. The widow
was rejoiced at the depression of her son:</p>

<p>"You have one means of getting out of the difficulty:
denounce us!"</p>

<p>"I ought, but I will not; and you know that right
well."</p>

<p>"That is why I have told you all this. Now, will
you go?"</p>

<p>Martial, wishing to soften this hag, said to her, in a
subdued voice:</p>

<p>"Mother, I do not believe you are capable of this
murder!"</p>

<p>"As you please; but go!"</p>

<p>"I will go on one condition."</p>

<p>"No condition at all!"</p>

<p>"You shall put the children apprentices somewhere in
the country."</p>

<p>"They shall remain here!"</p>

<p>"But, mother, when you have made them like Nicholas,
Calabash, Ambroise, my father,&mdash;what good will
that be to you?"</p>

<p>"To make good 'jobs' by their assistance. We are
not too many now. Calabash will remain here with me
to keep the cabaret. Nicholas is alone. Once properly
instructed, François and Amandine will help him. They
have already been pelted with stones,&mdash;young as they
are,&mdash;and they must revenge themselves!"</p>

<p>"Mother, you love Calabash and Nicholas, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, if I do, what then?"</p>

<p>"Suppose the children imitate them, and their crimes
are detected?"</p>

<p>"Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"They will come to the scaffold, like my father."</p>

<p>"What then? What then?"</p>

<p>"And does not their probable fate make you tremble?"</p>

<p>"That fate will be mine, neither better nor worse.
I rob, they rob; I kill, they kill. Whoever takes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
mother will take the young ones; we will not leave each
other. If our heads fall, theirs will fall in the same
basket, and we shall all take leave at once! We will
not retreat! You are the only coward in the family,
and we drive you from us!"</p>

<p>"But the children,&mdash;the children!"</p>

<p>"The children will grow up, and, but for you, they
would have been quite formed already. François is
almost ready, and, when you are gone, Amandine will
make up for lost time."</p>

<p>"Mother, I entreat of you, consent to having the
children sent away from here, and put in apprenticeship
at a distance."</p>

<p>"I tell you that they are in apprenticeship here!"</p>

<p>The felon's widow uttered these last words so immovably
that Martial lost all hope of mollifying this soul of
bronze.</p>

<p>"Since it is so," he replied, "hear me in my turn,
mother,&mdash;I remain!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Not in this house. I shall be assassinated by Nicholas,
or poisoned by Calabash. But, as I have no means
of lodging elsewhere, I and the children will occupy the
hovel at the end of the island; the door of that is
strong, and I will make it still more secure. Once
there, I will barricade myself, and, with my gun, my
stick, and my dog, I am afraid of no one. To-morrow
morning I will take the children with me. During the
day they will be with me, either in my boat or elsewhere;
and, at night, they shall sleep near me in the
hovel. We can live on the fish I catch until I find some
means of placing them, and find it I will."</p>

<p>"Oh! That's it, is it?"</p>

<p>"Neither you, nor my brother, nor Calabash can prevent
this, can you? If your robberies and murders are
discovered during my abode on the island, so much the
worse; but I'll chance it. I will declare that I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
back and remained here in consequence of the children,
to prevent them from becoming infamous. They will
decide. The children shall not remain another day in
this abode; and I defy you and your gang to drive me
from this island!"</p>

<p>The widow knew Martial's resolution, and the children,
who loved their eldest brother as much as they
feared her, would certainly follow him unhesitatingly
whenever and wherever he called them. As to himself,
well armed and most determined, always on his guard,
in his boat during the day, and secure and barricaded in
the hovel on the island at night, he had nothing to fear
from the malevolence of his family.</p>

<p>Martial's project, then, might be realised in every
particular; but the widow had many reasons for preventing
its execution. In the first place, as honest
work-people sometimes consider the number of their
children as wealth, in consequence of the services
which they derive from them, the widow relied on
Amandine and François to assist her in her atrocities.
Then, what she had said of her desire to avenge her
husband and son was true. Certain beings, nurtured,
matured, hardened in crime, enter into open revolt, into
war of extermination, against society, and believe that,
lay fresh crimes, they shall avenge themselves for the
just penalties which have been exacted from them
and those belonging to them. Then, too, the sinister
designs of Nicholas against Fleur-de-Marie, and afterwards
against the jewel-matcher, might be thwarted by
Martial's presence.</p>

<p>The widow had hoped to effect an immediate separation
between herself and Martial, either by keeping up
and aiding Nicholas's quarrel, or by disclosing to him
that, if he obstinately persisted in remaining in the
island, he ran the risk of being suspected as an accomplice
in many crimes.</p>

<p>As cunning as she was penetrating, the widow, perceiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
that she had failed, saw that she must have
recourse to treachery to entrap her son in her bloody
snare, and she therefore replied, after a lengthened
pause, with assumed bitterness:</p>

<p>"I see your plan. You will not inform against us
yourself, but you will contrive that the children shall
do so."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"They know now that there is a man buried here;
they know that Nicholas has robbed. Once apprenticed
they would talk, we should be apprehended, and we
should all suffer,&mdash;you with us. That is what would
happen if I listened to you, and allowed you to place
the children elsewhere. Yet you say you do not wish
us any harm? I do not ask you to love me; but do not
hasten the hour of our apprehension!"</p>

<p>The milder tone of the widow made Martial believe
that his threats had produced a salutary effect on her,
and he fell into the fearful snare.</p>

<p>"I know the children," he replied; "and I am sure
that, in desiring them to say nothing, not a word will
they say. Besides, in one way or another, I shall be
always with them, and I will answer for their silence."</p>

<p>"Can we answer for the chatter of children, especially
in Paris, where people are so curious and so gossiping?
It is as much that they should not betray us, as that
they should assist us in our plans, that I desire to keep
them here."</p>

<p>"Don't they go sometimes to the villages, and even to
Paris? Who could prevent them from talking if they
were inclined to talk? If they were a long way off,
why, so much the better; for what they would then say
would do us no harm."</p>

<p>"A long way off,&mdash;and where?" inquired the widow,
looking steadfastly at her son.</p>

<p>"Let me take them away,&mdash;where is no consequence
to you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"How will you and they live?"</p>

<p>"My old master, the locksmith, is a worthy man, and
I will tell him as much as he need know, and, perhaps,
he will lend me something for the sake of the children;
with that I will go and apprentice them a long way off.
We will leave in two days, and you will hear no more
of us."</p>

<p>"No, no! I prefer their remaining with me. I shall
then be perfectly sure of them."</p>

<p>"Then I will take up my quarters in the hovel on the
island until something turns up. I have a way and a
will of my own, and you know it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it. Oh, how I wish you were a thousand
miles away! Why didn't you remain in your
woods?"</p>

<p>"I offer to rid you of myself and the children."</p>

<p>"What! Would you leave La Louve here, whom you
love so much?" asked the widow, suddenly.</p>

<p>"That's my affair. I know what I shall do. I have
my plans."</p>

<p>"If I let you take away Amandine and François, will
you never again set foot in Paris?"</p>

<p>"Before three days have passed, we shall have departed,
and be as dead to you."</p>

<p>"I prefer that to having you here, and always distrusting
you and them. So, since I must give way, take
them, and be off as quickly as possible, and never let me
see you more!"</p>

<p>"Agreed!"</p>

<p>"Agreed! Give me the key of the cellar, that I may
let Nicholas out!"</p>

<p>"No; let him sleep his liquor off, and I'll give you
the key to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"And Calabash?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's another affair! Let her out when I have
gone. I can't bear the sight of her."</p>

<p>"Go, and may hell confound you!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's your farewell, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Fortunately your last!" said Martial.</p>

<p>"My last!" responded the widow.</p>

<p>Her son lighted a candle, then opened the kitchen
door, whistled to his dog, who ran in, quite delighted at
being admitted, and followed his master to the upper
story of the house.</p>

<p>"Go,&mdash;your business is settled!" muttered the widow,
shaking her clenched hand at her son, as he went up the
stairs; "but it is your own act."</p>

<p>Then, by Calabash's assistance, who brought her a
bundle of false keys, the widow unlocked the cellar
door where Nicholas was, and set him at liberty.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h5>FRANÇOIS AND AMANDINE.</h5>


<p>François and Amandine slept in a room immediately
over the kitchen, and at the end of a passage which communicated
with several other apartments that were used
as "company rooms" for the guests who frequented the
cabaret. After having eaten their frugal supper, instead
of putting out their lantern, as the widow had
ordered them, the two children watched, leaving their
door ajar, for their brother Martial's passing on his way
to his own chamber.</p>

<p>Placed on a crippled stool, the lantern shed its dull
beams through the transparent horn. Walls of plaster,
with here and there brown deal boards, a flock-bed for
François, a little old child's bed, much too short, for
Amandine, a pile of broken chairs and dismembered
benches, mementoes of the turbulent visitors to the
cabaret of the Isle du Ravageur,&mdash;such was the interior
of this dog-hole.</p>

<p>Amandine, seated at the edge of the bed, was trying
how to dress her head <i>en marmotte</i>, with the stolen silk
handkerchief, the gift of her brother Nicholas. François
was on his knees, holding up a piece of broken glass to
his sister, who, with her head half turned, was employed
in spreading out the large rosette which she had made
in tying the two ends of the kerchief together. Wonder-struck
at this head-dress, François for an instant neglected
to present the bit of glass in such a way that her
face could be reflected in it.</p>

<p>"Lift the looking-glass higher," said Amandine; "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
can't see myself at all now! There, that's it,&mdash;that'll
do! Hold it so a minute! Now I've done it! Well,
look! How have I done my head?"</p>

<p>"Oh, capitally,&mdash;excellently! What a handsome
rosette! You'll make me just such a one for my
cravat, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, directly. But let me walk up and down a
little. You can go before me&mdash;backwards&mdash;holding
the glass up, just in that way. There&mdash;so! I can
then see myself as I walk."</p>

<p>François then went through this difficult man&oelig;uvre
to the great satisfaction of Amandine, who strutted up
and down in all her pride and dignity, under the large
bow of her head attire.</p>

<p>Very simple and unsophisticated under any other circumstances,
this coquetry became guilt when displayed
in reference to the produce of a robbery of which François
and Amandine were not ignorant. Another proof
of the frightful facility with which children, however
well disposed, become corrupted almost imperceptibly
when they are continually immersed in a criminal
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Then, the sole mentor of these unfortunate children,
their brother Martial, was by no means irreproachable
himself, as we have already said. Incapable, it is true,
of a theft or a murder, still he led a vagabond and ill-regulated
life. Undoubtedly his mind revolted at the
crimes of his family. He loved these two children very
fondly, and protected them from ill-treatment, endeavouring
to withdraw them from the pernicious influences
of the family; but not taking his stand on the foundations
of rigorous and sound morality, his advice was but
an ineffective safeguard to these children. They refused
to commit certain bad actions, not from honest sentiments,
but in order to obey Martial, whom they loved,
and to disobey their mother, whom they dreaded and
hated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>As to ideas of right and wrong, they had none, familiarised
as they were with the infamous examples which
they had every day under their eyes; for, as we have
said, this country cabaret, haunted by the refuse of the
lowest order, was the theatre of most disgraceful orgies
and most disgusting debaucheries; and Martial, opposed
as he was to thefts and murders, appeared perfectly indifferent
to these infamous saturnalia.</p>

<p>It may be supposed, therefore, that the instincts of
morality in these children were doubtful and precarious,
especially those of François, who had reached that dangerous
time of life when the mind pauses, and, oscillating
between good and evil, might be in a moment lost or
saved.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>"How well you look in that handkerchief, sister!"
said François; "it is very pretty. When we go to play
on the shore by the chalk-burner's lime-kiln you must
dress yourself in this manner, to make the children jealous
who pelt us with stones and call us little guillotines.
And I shall put on my nice red cravat, and we
will say to them, 'Never mind, you haven't such pretty
silk handkerchiefs as we have!'"</p>

<p>"But, I say, François," said Amandine, after a
moment's reflection, "if they knew that the handkerchiefs
we wear were stolen, they would call us little
thieves."</p>

<p>"Well, and what should we care if they did call us
little thieves?"</p>

<p>"Why, not at all, if it were not true. But now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Since Nicholas gave us these handkerchiefs, we
didn't steal them!"</p>

<p>"No; but he took them out of a barge; and Brother
Martial says no one ought to steal."</p>

<p>"But, as Nicholas states, that is no affair of ours."</p>

<p>"Do you think so, François?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still, it seems to me that I would rather the person
who really owns them had given them to us. What do
you say, François?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all one to me! They were given to us, and
so they're ours."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;yes; make yourself easy about that."</p>

<p>"So much the better, then, for we are not doing what
Brother Martial forbids, and we have such nice handkerchiefs!"</p>

<p>"But, Amandine, if he had known the other day that
Calabash had made you take the plaid handkerchief
from the peddler's pack whilst his back was turned?"</p>

<p>"Oh, François, don't talk about it; I have been so
very sorry. But I was really forced to do it, for my
sister pinched me until the blood came, and looked at
me so&mdash;oh, in such a way! And yet my heart failed
me twice, and I thought I never could do it. The peddler
didn't find it out; yet, if they had caught me, François,
I should have been sent to prison."</p>

<p>"But you weren't caught; so it's just the same as if
you had not stolen."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And in prison how unhappy we must be."</p>

<p>"On the contrary&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you mean on the contrary?"</p>

<p>"Why, you know the fat cripple who lodges at Father
Micou's, the man who buys all Nicholas's things, and
keeps a lodging-house in the Passage de la Brasserie?"</p>

<p>"A fat cripple?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, who came here the end of last autumn
from Father Micou, with a man who had monkeys and
two women."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, a stout, lame man, who spent such a deal
of money."</p>

<p>"I believe you; he paid for everybody. Don't you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
recollect the rows on the water when I pulled them, and
the man with the monkeys brought his organ, that they
might have music in the boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and in the evening the beautiful fireworks
they let off, François?"</p>

<p>"And the fat cripple was not stingy, either. He
gave me ten sous for myself. He drank nothing but
our best wine, and they had chickens at every meal.
He spent full eighty francs."</p>

<p>"So much as that, François?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"How rich he must be!"</p>

<p>"Not at all. What he spent was money he had
gained in prison, from which he had just come."</p>

<p>"Gained all that money in prison?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he said he had seven hundred francs beside,
and that, when that was all gone, he should try another
good 'job;' and if he were taken, he didn't care,
because he should go back to his jolly 'pals in the
Stone Jug,' as he said."</p>

<p>"Then he wasn't afraid of prison, François?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary; he told Calabash that they were
a party of friends and merrymakers all together; and
that he had never had a better bed and better food than
when he was in prison. Good meat four times a week,
fire all the winter, and a lump of money when he left
it; whilst there are fools of honest workmen who are
starving with cold and hunger, for want of work."</p>

<p>"Are you sure he said that, François,&mdash;the stout
lame man?"</p>

<p>"I heard him, for I was rowing him in the punt
whilst he told his story to Calabash and the two women,
who said that it was the same thing in the female
prisons they had just left."</p>

<p>"But then, François, it can't be so bad to steal, if
people are so well off in prison."</p>

<p>"Oh, the deuce! I don't know. Here it is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Brother Martial who says it is wrong to steal; perhaps
he is wrong."</p>

<p>"Never mind if he is, François. We ought to believe
him, for he loves us so much!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he loves us; and, when he is by, there is no
fear of our being beaten. If he had been here this
evening, our mother would not have thrashed me so.
An old beast! How savage she is! Oh, how I hate
her&mdash;hate her! And how I wish I was grown up, that
I might pay her back the thumps she gives us, especially
to you, who can't bear them as well as I can."</p>

<p>"Oh, François, hold your tongue; it quite frightens
me to hear you say that you would beat mother!"
cried the poor little child, weeping, and throwing
her arms around her brother's neck, and kissing him
affectionately.</p>

<p>"It's quite true, though," answered François, extricating
himself gently from Amandine. "Why are my
mother and Calabash always so savage to us?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Amandine, wiping her eyes
with the back of her hand. "It is, perhaps, because
they sent Brother Ambroise to the galleys, and guillotined
our father, that they are unjust towards us."</p>

<p>"Is that our fault?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! But what would you have?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> If I am always to have beatings,&mdash;always,
always, at last I should rather steal, as they do, I should.
What do I gain by not being a thief?"</p>

<p>"Ah, what would Martial say to that?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but for him, I should have said yes a long time
ago, for I am tired of being thumped for ever; why, this
evening, my mother was more savage than ever; she
was like a fury! It was pitch dark. She didn't say
a word; and I felt nothing but her clammy hand holding
me by the scruff of my neck, whilst with the other
she beat me; and whilst she did so, her eyes seemed to
glare in the dark."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor François! for only having said you saw a dead
man's bone by the wood-pile."</p>

<p>"Yes, a foot that was sticking out of the ground,"
said François, shuddering with fright; "I am quite
sure of it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there was a burying-ground there once."</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but then, why did mother say she'd be
the death of me, if I said a word about the bone to our
Brother Martial? I rather think it is some one who
has been killed in a quarrel, and that they have buried
him there, that no one might know anything about it."</p>

<p>"You are right; for don't you remember that such a
thing did nearly happen once?"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember once when M. Barbillon
wounded with a knife that tall man, who is so very
thin, that he showed himself for money?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the walking skeleton, as they call him? Yes;
and mother came and separated them; if she hadn't, I
think Barbillon would have killed the tall, thin man.
Did you see how Barbillon foamed at the mouth? and
his eyes seemed ready to start from his head. Oh, he
does not mind who he cuts and slashes with his knife,&mdash;he's
such a headstrong, passionate fellow!"</p>

<p>"So young and so wicked, François?"</p>

<p>"Tortillard is much younger, and he would be quite
as wicked as he, if he were strong enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's very, very wicked! The other day he
beat me, because I would not play with him."</p>

<p>"He beat you, did he? Then, the first time he
comes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, François; it was only in jest."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite sure."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, for, if not&mdash;But I don't know
how he manages, the scamp! But he always has so
much money. He's so lucky! When he came here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
with the Chouette, he showed us pieces of gold of
twenty francs; and didn't he look knowing as he said,
'Oh, you might have the same, if you were not such
little muffs!'"</p>

<p>"Muffs?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in slang that means fools, simpletons."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Forty francs in gold! What a many fine things I
could buy with that! Couldn't you, Amandine?"</p>

<p>"That I could."</p>

<p>"What should you buy?"</p>

<p>"Let's see," said the little girl, bending her head, and
meditating. "I should first buy Brother Martial a good
thick outside coat, that would keep him warm in his
boat."</p>

<p>"But for yourself,&mdash;for yourself."</p>

<p>"I should like a crucifixion, like those image-sellers
had on Sunday, you know, under the church porch at
Asnières."</p>

<p>"Yes; and, now I think of it, we must not tell
mother or Calabash that we went into a church."</p>

<p>"To be sure, for she has always forbidden us to go
into a church. What a pity! For church is such
a nice place inside, isn't it, François?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and what beautiful silver candlesticks!"</p>

<p>"And the picture of the holy Virgin, how kind she
looks!"</p>

<p>"And did you look at the fine lamps, and the handsome
cloth on the large table at the bottom, when the
priest was saying mass with his two friends, dressed like
himself, and who gave him water and wine?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, François, do you remember last year, at
the Fête-Dieu, when we saw from here the little communicants,
with their white veils, pass over the bridge?"</p>

<p>"What nice nosegays they had!"</p>

<p>"How they sang in a soft tone, holding the ribands
of their banners!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how the silver lace of their banners shone in
the sunshine! What a deal of money it must have
cost!"</p>

<p>"Oh, how beautiful it was! Wasn't it, François?"</p>

<p>"I believe you! And the communicants with their
bows of white satin on the arm, and their wax candles,
with red velvet and gold on the part by which they hold
them."</p>

<p>"And the little boys had their banners, too, hadn't
they, François? Ah, François, how I was thumped
that day for asking our mother why we did not go in
the procession, like the other children!"</p>

<p>"And it was then she forbade us from ever going into
a church when we should go into the town, or to Paris;
'Unless it was to rob the poor-box, or the pockets of
the people who were hearing mass,' Calabash said, grinning,
and showing her nasty yellow teeth. Oh, what a
bad thing she is!"</p>

<p>"Oh, and as for that, they should kill me before
I would rob in a church; and you, too, François?"</p>

<p>"There, or anywhere; what difference does it make,
when once one has made up one's mind?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know; but I should be so frightened,
I could never do it."</p>

<p>"Because of the priests?"</p>

<p>"No; but because of the portrait of the holy Virgin,
who seems so kind and good."</p>

<p>"What consequence is a portrait? It won't eat or
drink, you silly child!"</p>

<p>"That's very true; but then I really couldn't. It is
not my fault."</p>

<p>"Talking of priests, Amandine, do you remember
that day when Nicholas gave me two such hard boxes
on the ear, because he saw me make a bow to the
curate, who passed on the bank? I had seen everybody
salute him, and so I saluted him; I didn't think
I was doing any wrong."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but then, you know, Brother Martial said, as
Nicholas did, that there was no occasion to salute the
priests."</p>

<p>At this moment François and Amandine heard footsteps
in the passage. Martial was going to his chamber,
without any mistrust, after his conversation with his
mother, believing that Nicholas was safely locked up
until the next morning. Seeing a ray of light coming
from out the closet in which the children slept, Martial
came into the room. They both ran to him, and
he embraced them affectionately.</p>

<p>"What! Not in bed yet, little gossips?"</p>

<p>"No, brother, we waited until you came, that we
might see you, and wish you good night," said Amandine.</p>

<p>"And then we heard you speaking very loud below,
as if there were a quarrel," added François.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Martial, "I had some dispute with Nicholas,
but it was nothing. Besides, I am glad to see you
awake, as I have some good news for you."</p>

<p>"For us, brother?"</p>

<p>"Should you like to go away from here, and come
with me a long way off?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, brother!"</p>

<p>"Yes, brother!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, in two or three days we shall all three
leave the island."</p>

<p>"Oh, how delightful!" exclaimed Amandine, clapping
her hands with joy.</p>

<p>"And where shall we go to?" inquired François.</p>

<p>"You will see, Mr. Inquisitive; no matter; but where
you will learn a good trade, which will enable you to
earn your living, be sure of that."</p>

<p>"Then I sha'n't go fishing with you any more,
brother?"</p>

<p>"No, my boy, you will be put apprentice to a carpenter
or locksmith. You are strong and handy, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
a good heart; and working hard, at the end of a year
you may already have earned something. But you don't
seem to like it: why, what ails you now?"</p>

<p>"Why, brother,&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, come! Speak out."</p>

<p>"Why, I'd rather not leave you, but stay with you,
and fish, and mend your nets, than go and learn a
trade."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Why, to be shut up in a workshop all day is so
very dull; and then it must be so tiresome to be an
apprentice."</p>

<p>Martial shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"So, then, you would rather be an idler, a scamp, a
vagabond,&mdash;eh?" said he, in a stern voice; "and then,
perhaps, a thief?"</p>

<p>"No, brother; but I should like to live with you
elsewhere, as we live here, that's all."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it; eat, drink, sleep, and amuse yourself
with fishing, like an independent gentleman,&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I should like it."</p>

<p>"Very likely; but you must prefer something else.
You see, my poor dear lad, that it is quite time I took
you away from here; for, without perceiving it, you
have become as idle as the rest. My mother was right,&mdash;I
fear you have vice in you. And you, Amandine,
shouldn't you like to learn some business?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, brother; I should like very much to learn
anything rather than stay here. I should dearly like to
go with you and François."</p>

<p>"But what have you got on your head, my child?"
inquired Martial, observing Amandine's very fine head-dress.</p>

<p>"A handkerchief that Nicholas gave me."</p>

<p>"And he gave me one, too," said François, with an
air of pride.</p>

<p>"And where did these handkerchiefs come from? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
should be very much surprised to learn that Nicholas
bought them to make you a present of."</p>

<p>The two children lowered their eyes, and made no
reply. After a second, François said, with a resolute
air, "Nicholas gave them to us. We do not know where
they came from, do we, Amandine?"</p>

<p>"No, no, brother," replied Amandine, stammering,
and turning very red, not daring to look Martial in the
face.</p>

<p>"Don't tell lies," said Martial, harshly.</p>

<p>"We don't tell lies," replied François, doggedly.</p>

<p>"Amandine, my child, tell the truth," said Martial,
mildly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, to tell the whole truth," replied Amandine,
timidly, "these fine handkerchiefs came out of a
box of things that Nicholas brought in this evening in
his boat."</p>

<p>"And which he had stolen?"</p>

<p>"I think so, brother,&mdash;out of a barge."</p>

<p>"So then, François, you lie?" said Martial.</p>

<p>The boy bent down his head, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"Give me this handkerchief, Amandine; and yours,
too, François."</p>

<p>The little girl took off her head-dress, gave a last look
at the large bow, which was not untied, and gave the
handkerchief to Martial, repressing a sigh of regret.
François drew his slowly out of his pocket, and then
gave it to his brother, as his sister had done.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning," he said, "I will return these
handkerchiefs to Nicholas. You ought not to have taken
them, children. To profit by a robbery is as if one robbed
oneself."</p>

<p>"It is a pity those handkerchiefs were so pretty!"
said François.</p>

<p>"When you have learned a trade, and earn money by
your work, you will buy some as good. Go to bed, my
dears,&mdash;it is very late."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are not angry, brother?" said Amandine,
timidly.</p>

<p>"No, no, my love, it is not your fault. You live with
ill-disposed persons, and you do as they do unconsciously.
When you are with honest persons, you will do as they
do; and you'll soon be with such, or the devil's in it.
So now, good night!"</p>

<p>"Good night, brother!"</p>

<p>Martial kissed the children. They were now alone.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, François,&mdash;you seem
very sorrowful!" said Amandine.</p>

<p>"Why, brother has taken my nice handkerchief; and
besides, didn't you hear what he said?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He means to take us with him, and put us
apprentice."</p>

<p>"And ain't you glad?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, no!"</p>

<p>"Would you rather stay here and be beaten every
day?"</p>

<p>"Why, if I am beaten I am not made to work. I am
all day in the boat, fishing, or playing, or waiting on the
customers, who sometimes give me something, as the stout
lame man did. It is much more amusing than to be
from morning till night shut up in a workshop working
like a dog."</p>

<p>"But didn't you understand? Why, brother said that
if we remained here longer we should become evil-disposed."</p>

<p>"Ah! bah! That's all one to me, since the other
children call us already little thieves,&mdash;little guillotines!
And then to work is too tiresome!"</p>

<p>"But here they are always beating us, brother!"</p>

<p>"They beat us because we listen to Martial more than
to any one else."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is so kind to us!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is kind,&mdash;very kind,&mdash;I don't say he ain't;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and I am very fond of him. No one dares to be unkind
to us when he is by. He takes us out with him,&mdash;that's
true; but that's all; he never gives us anything."</p>

<p>"Why, he has nothing. What he gains he gives our
mother to pay for his eating, drinking, and lodging."</p>

<p>"Nicholas has something. You may be sure if we
attend to what he and mother say, they would not make
our lives so uncomfortable, but give us pretty things, as
they did to-day. They would not distrust us, and we
should have money like Tortillard."</p>

<p>"But we must steal for that; and how that would
grieve dear, good Martial!"</p>

<p>"Well, so much the worse!"</p>

<p>"Oh, François! And then we should be taken up and
put into prison."</p>

<p>"To be in a prison or shut up in a workshop all day is
the same thing. Besides, the Gros-Boiteux says they
amuse themselves very much in prison."</p>

<p>"But how sorry Martial would be; only think of that!
And then it is on our account that he returned here, and
remains with us! For himself only he would not have
any difficulty, but could go again and be a poacher in
the woods which he is so very fond of."</p>

<p>"Oh, if he'll take us with him into the woods," said
François, "that would be better than anything else. I
should be with him I am so fond of, and should not
work at any business that would tire me."</p>

<p>The conversation of François and Amandine was
interrupted. Some one outside double-locked their
door.</p>

<p>"They have fastened us in," said François.</p>

<p>"Oh, what can it be for, brother? What are they
going to do to us?"</p>

<p>"It is Martial, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Listen, listen,&mdash;how his dog barks!" said Amandine,
listening.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, François added:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"It sounds as if some one were knocking at his door
with a hammer. Perhaps they want to force it open!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but how the dog barks still!"</p>

<p>"Listen, François! It is as if they were nailing
something. Oh, dear, oh, dear, how frightened I am!
What are they doing to our brother? And how the dog
howls still!"</p>

<p>"Amandine, I hear nothing now," said François,
going towards the door.</p>

<p>The two children held their breath, and listened
anxiously.</p>

<p>"They are coming from my brother's room," said
François, in a low voice; "I hear them walking in the
passage."</p>

<p>"Let us throw ourselves on our beds; mother would
kill us if she found us out of bed," said Amandine,
terrified.</p>

<p>"No," said François, still listening; "they have just
passed by our door, and are running down the staircase."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, oh, dear, what can it be?"</p>

<p>"Ah, now they are opening the kitchen door."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I know the sound."</p>

<p>"Martial's dog is still howling," said Amandine,
listening. Suddenly she exclaimed, "François, our
brother calls us."</p>

<p>"Martial?"</p>

<p>"Yes; don't you hear him? Don't you hear him
now?"</p>

<p>And at this moment, in spite of the thickness of the
two closed doors, the powerful voice of Martial, who
called to the children from his room, reached them.</p>

<p>"Indeed, we can't go to him; we are locked in," said
Amandine. "They must be doing something wrong to
him, as he calls us."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, if I could hinder them," exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
François, resolutely, "I would, even if they were to cut
me to pieces!"</p>

<p>"But our brother does not know that they have
double-locked our door, and he will believe that we
would not go to his help. Call out to him that we are
locked in, François."</p>

<p>The lad was just going to do as his sister bade him,
when a violent blow was struck outside the shutter of
the window of the room in which the two children were.</p>

<p>"They are coming in by the window to kill us!"
cried Amandine, and, in her fright, she threw herself
on her bed and hid her head between her hands.</p>

<p>François remained motionless, although he shared his
sister's terror. However, after the violent blow we have
mentioned, the shutter was not opened, and the most
profound silence reigned throughout the house. Martial
had ceased calling to the children.</p>

<p>A little assured, and excited by intense curiosity,
François ventured to open the window a little way, and
tried to look out through the leaves of the blind.</p>

<p>"Mind, brother!" said Amandine, in a low voice,
and sitting up when she heard François open the
shutter.</p>

<p>"Can you see anything?" she added.</p>

<p>"No, the night is too dark."</p>

<p>"Don't you hear anything?"</p>

<p>"No, the wind is too high."</p>

<p>"Come in, then; come in."</p>

<p>"Oh, now I see something!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The light of a lantern, which moves backwards and
forwards."</p>

<p>"Who's carrying it?"</p>

<p>"I can only see the light. Ah, she comes nearer,&mdash;she
is speaking!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Listen,&mdash;listen! It is Calabash."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"What does she say?"</p>

<p>"She says the ladder must be fixed securely."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was then in taking away the high ladder that
was placed against our shutter that they made that noise
just now."</p>

<p>"I don't hear anything now."</p>

<p>"What have they done with the ladder?"</p>

<p>"I can't see it now."</p>

<p>"Can you hear anything?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"François, perhaps they are going to use it to enter
our Brother Martial's room by the window!"</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"If you could open our window a little more you
might see."</p>

<p>"I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Only a little bit."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! If mother saw us!"</p>

<p>"It is so dark, there is no danger."</p>

<p>François, much against his will, did as his sister
requested, and pushing the shutter back, looked
out.</p>

<p>"Well, brother?" said Amandine, surmounting her
fears, and approaching François on tiptoe.</p>

<p>"By the gleam of the lantern," said he, "I see
Calabash, who is holding the foot of the ladder, which
is resting against Martial's window."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Nicholas is going up the ladder with his axe in his
hand. I see it glitter."</p>

<p>"Ah, you are not in bed, then, but watching us!"
exclaimed the widow, addressing François and his
sister from outside. As she was returning to the
kitchen she saw the light, which escaped through the
open window.</p>

<p>The unfortunate children had neglected putting out
the lantern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am coming," added the widow, in a terrible voice;
"I am coming to you, you little spies!"</p>

<p>Such were the events which passed in the Isle du
Ravageur on the evening of the day before that on
which Madame Séraphin was to take Fleur-de-Marie
thither.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h5>A LODGING-HOUSE.</h5>


<p>The Passage de la Brasserie, a dark street, narrow,
and but little known, although situated in the centre of
Paris, runs at one end into the Rue Traversière St.
Honoré, and at the other into the Cour St. Guillaume.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of this damp thoroughfare, muddy,
dark, and unwholesome, and where the sun but rarely
penetrates, there was a furnished house (commonly
called a <i>garni</i>, lodging-house, in consequence of the low
price of the apartments). On a miserable piece of paper
might be read, "Chambers and small rooms furnished."
To the right hand, in a dark alley, was the door of a
store, not less obscure, in which constantly resided the
principal tenant of this <i>garni</i>.</p>

<p>Father Micou was ostensibly a dealer in old metal
("marine stores"), but secretly purchased and received
stolen metal, iron, lead, brass, and tin. When we mention
that Father Micou was connected in business and
friendship with the Martial family, we give a tolerable
idea of his morality. The tie that binds&mdash;the sort of
affiliation, the mysterious communion, which connects&mdash;the
malefactors of Paris, is at once curious and
fearful. The common prisons are the great centres
whence flow, and to which reflow, incessantly those
waves of corruption which gradually gain on the capital,
and leave there such pernicious waifs and strays.</p>

<p>Father Micou was a stout man, about fifty years of
age, with a mean and cunning countenance, a mulberry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
nose, and wine-flushed cheeks. He wore a fur cap and
an old green long-skirted coat. Over his small stove,
near which he was standing, there was a board fastened
to the wall, and bearing a row of figures, to which were
affixed the keys of the chambers of the absent lodgers.
The panes of glass in the door which opened on to the
street were so painted that from the outside no one
could see what was going on within.</p>

<p>The whole of this extensive store was very dark.
From the damp walls there hung rusty chains of all
sizes; and the floor was strewed with iron and other
metals. Three blows struck at the door in a particular
way attracted the attention of the landlord, huckster,
receiver.</p>

<p>"Come in!" he cried.</p>

<p>It was Nicholas, the son of the felon's widow. He
was very pale, his features looked even more evil than
they did on the previous evening, and yet he feigned a
kind of overgaiety during the following conversation.
(This scene takes place on the day after his quarrel with.
Martial.)</p>

<p>"Ah, is it you, my fine fellow?" said Micou, cordially.</p>

<p>"Yes, Father Micou, I have come to see you on a
trifle of business."</p>

<p>"Then shut the door,&mdash;shut the door."</p>

<p>"My dog and cart are there outside with the stuff."</p>

<p>"What do you bring me, double tripe (sheet lead)?"</p>

<p>"No, Father Micou."</p>

<p>"What is it, scrapings? but no, you're too downy
now, you've left off work. Perhaps it is a bit of hard
(iron)?"</p>

<p>"No, Daddy Micou, it's some flap (sheet copper).
There must be, at least, a hundred and fifty pounds
weight, as much as my dog could stagger along with."</p>

<p>"Go and fetch the flap, and let's weigh it."</p>

<p>"You must lend a hand, daddy, for I've hurt my
arm."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>And, at the recollection of his contest with his brother
Martial, the ruffian's features expressed, at once, the
resentment of hatred and savage joy, as if his vengeance
were already satisfied.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your arm, my man?"</p>

<p>"Nothing,&mdash;only a sprain."</p>

<p>"You must heat an iron in the fire, and plunge it red-hot
into the water, then put your arm in the water as
hot as you can bear it. It is an iron-dealer's remedy,
but none the worse for that."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, Father Micou."</p>

<p>"Go and fetch the flap, and I'll come and help you,
idle-bones."</p>

<p>At twice the copper was brought out of the cart,
drawn by an enormous dog, and conveyed into the shop.</p>

<p>"That cart of yours is a good idea," said the worthy
Micou, as he adjusted the wooden frames of an enormous
pair of scales that hung from a beam in the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Yes; when I've anything to bring, I put my dog
and cart into the punt, and harness them as we come
along. A hackney-coach might, perhaps, tell a tale, but
my dog never chatters."</p>

<p>"And they're all pretty well at home,&mdash;eh?" inquired
the receiver, weighing the copper; "mother and sister,
both pretty bobbish?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Father Micou."</p>

<p>"And the little uns?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the little uns, too. And your nephew, André,
where is he?"</p>

<p>"Don't mention him; he was out on a spree yesterday.
Barbillon and Gros-Boiteux brought him back this morning.
He is out for a walk now towards the General
Post-office in the Rue St. Jacques Rousseau. And
your brother, Martial, is he just such a rum un as ever?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> I don't know."</p>

<p>"Don't know?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Nicholas, assuming an indifferent air;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
"we have seen nothing of him for the last two days.
Perhaps he's gone poaching in the woods again; unless
his boat, which was very, very old, has sunk in the river,
with him in it."</p>

<p>"At which you would not be dreadfully affected, you
bad lot, for you can't bear your brother, I know."</p>

<p>"True; we have strange likes and dislikes. How
many pounds of metal d'ye make?"</p>

<p>"You're right to a hair, just a hundred and fifty
pounds, my lad."</p>

<p>"And you owe me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just thirty francs."</p>

<p>"Thirty francs! when copper is twenty sous a pound?
Thirty francs!"</p>

<p>"Say thirty-five francs, and there's an end of the
matter, or go to the devil with you! you, and your
copper, and your dog, and your cart."</p>

<p>"But, Father Micou, you are really chiselling me down;
that's not the right thing by no means."</p>

<p>"If you'll tell me how you came by your copper, I'll
give you fifteen sous a pound for it."</p>

<p>"That's the old strain. You are all alike, a regular
lot of cheats. How can you bear to 'do' your friends in
this way? But that's not all; if I swap with you for
some things, you ought to give me good measure."</p>

<p>"To a hair's turn. What do you want? Chains and
hooks for your punts?"</p>

<p>"No, I want four or five sheets of stout iron, as if to
line shutters with."</p>

<p>"I've just the thing, a quarter of an inch thick; a
pistol-ball wouldn't go through it."</p>

<p>"Just what I want."</p>

<p>"What size?"</p>

<p>"Why, altogether about seven or eight feet square."</p>

<p>"Good, and what else?"</p>

<p>"Three bars of iron, from three to four feet long, and
two inches square."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have just broken up an iron wicket; nothing can
be better for you. What next?"</p>

<p>"Two strong hinges and a latch, so that I can open
or shut an opening two feet square when I wish."</p>

<p>"A trap, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, a valve."</p>

<p>"I don't understand what you can want with a
valve."</p>

<p>"Never you mind; I know what I want."</p>

<p>"That's all right; you have only to choose; there's
a heap of hinges. What's the next thing?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"And not much, either."</p>

<p>"Get it all ready, Father Micou, and I'll take it as
I come back; for I've got some other places to call
at."</p>

<p>"With your cart? Why, you dog, I saw a bundle
underneath. What, some little trifle you have taken
from the world's wardrobe? Ah, you sly rogue!"</p>

<p>"Just as you say, Father Micou; but you don't
deal in such things. Don't keep me waiting for the
iron goods, for I must be back at the island before
noon."</p>

<p>"I'll be ready. It is only eight, and, if you are not
going far, come back in an hour, and you shall find
everything prepared,&mdash;money and goods. Won't you
take a drain?"</p>

<p>"Thank ye, I won't say no, for I think you owe it
me."</p>

<p>Father Micou took from an old closet a bottle of
brandy, a cracked glass, and a cup without a handle,
and filled them.</p>

<p>"Here's to you, Daddy Micou!"</p>

<p>"And to you likewise, my boy, and the ladies at
home!"</p>

<p>"Thank ye. And the lodging-house goes on well,
eh?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Middling,&mdash;middling. I have always some lodgers
for whom I am always fearing a visit from the commissary;
but they pay in proportion."</p>

<p>"How d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, are you stupid? I sometimes lodge as I buy,
and don't ask them for their passport, any more than I
ask you for your bill of parcels."</p>

<p>"Good; but to them you let as dear as you have
bought cheaply of me."</p>

<p>"I must look out. I have a cousin who has a handsome
furnished house in the Rue St. Honoré. His
wife is a milliner in a large way, and employs, perhaps,
twenty needlewomen, either in the house, or having the
work at home."</p>

<p>"I say, old boy, I dare say there's some pretty uns
among 'em?"</p>

<p>"I believe you. There's two or three that I have
seen bring home work sometimes,&mdash;my eyes, ain't they
pretty, though? One little one in particular, who works
at home, and is always a-laughing, and they calls her
Rigolette, oh, my pippin, what a pity one ain't twenty
years old all over again!"</p>

<p>"Halloa, daddy, how you are going it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right, my boy,&mdash;all right!"</p>

<p>"'Walker!' old boy. And you say your cousin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does uncommon well with his house, and, as it is
the same number as that of the little Rigolette&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right and proper."</p>

<p>"'Walker!'"</p>

<p>"He won't have any lodgers but those who have passports
and papers; but if any come who haven't got 'em,
he sends me those customers."</p>

<p>"And they pays accordingly?"</p>

<p>"In course."</p>

<p>"But they are all in our line who haven't got their
riglar papers?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"By no manner of means! Why, very lately, my
cousin sent me a customer,&mdash;devil burn me if I can
make him out! Another drain?"</p>

<p>"Just one; the liquor's good. Here's t'ye again,
Daddy Micou!"</p>

<p>"Here's to you again, my covey! I was saying that
the other day my cousin sent me a customer whom I
can't make out. Imagine a mother and daughter, who
looked very queer and uncommon seedy; they had their
whole kit in a pocket-handkerchief. Well, there warn't
much to be expected out of this, for they had no papers,
and they lodge by the fortnight; yet, since they've been
here, they haven't moved any more than a dormouse.
No men come to see them; and yet they're not bad-looking,
if they weren't so thin and pale, particularly
the daughter, about sixteen,&mdash;with such a pair of black
eyes,&mdash;oh, such eyes!"</p>

<p>"Halloa, dad! You're off again. What do these
women do?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't know; they must be respectable,
and yet, as they receive letters without any address, it
looks queer."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"They sent, this morning, my nephew André to the
<i>Poste-Restante</i> to inquire for a letter addressed to 'Madame
X. Z.' The letter was expected from Normandy,
from a town called Aubiers. They wrote that down on
paper, so that André might get the letter by giving these
particulars. You see, it does not look quite the thing
for women to take the name of 'X.' and 'Z.' And yet
they never have any male visitors."</p>

<p>"They won't pay you."</p>

<p>"Oh, my fine fellow, they don't catch an old bird like
me with chaff. They took a room without a fireplace,
and I made them pay the twenty francs down for the
fortnight. They are, perhaps, ill, for they have not
been down for the last two days. It is not indigestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
that ails them, for I don't think they have cooked
anything since they came here."</p>

<p>"If you had all such customers, Father Micou&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, they go and come. If I lodge people without
passports, why, I also have different people. I have
now two travelling gents, a postman, the leader of the
band at the Café des Aveugles, and a lady of fortune,&mdash;all
most respectable persons, such as save the reputation
of a house, if the commissary is inclined to look a little
too closely into things; they are not night-lodgers, but
tenants of the broad sunshine."</p>

<p>"When it comes into your alley, Father Micou."</p>

<p>"You're a wag. Another drain, yes, just one more."</p>

<p>"Well, it must be my last, for then I must cut. By
the way, doesn't Robin, the Gros-Boiteux, lodge here
still?"</p>

<p>"Yes, up-stairs, on the same landing as the mother
and daughter. He's pretty nearly run through his
money he earned in gaol."</p>

<p>"I say, mind your eye,&mdash;he's outlawed."</p>

<p>"I know it, but I can't get rid of him. I think he's
got something in hand, for little Tortillard came here
the other night along with Barbillon. I'm afraid he'll
do something to my lodgers, so, when his fortnight is
up, I shall bundle him, telling him his room is taken for
an ambassador, or the husband of Madame Saint-Ildefonse,
my independent lady."</p>

<p>"An independent lady?"</p>

<p>"I believe you! Three rooms and a cabinet in the
front,&mdash;nothing less,&mdash;newly furnished, to say nothing
of an attic for her servant. Eighty francs a month, and
paid in advance by her uncle, to whom she gives one of
her spare rooms when he comes up from the country.
But I believe his country-house is about the Rue Vivienne,
or the Rue St. Honoré."</p>

<p>"I twig! She's independent because the old fellow
pays."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush! Here's her maid."</p>

<p>A middle-aged woman, wearing a white apron of
very doubtful cleanliness, entered the dealer's warehouse.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Madame Charles?"</p>

<p>"Father Micou, is your nephew within?"</p>

<p>"He has gone to the post-office; but I expect him in
immediately."</p>

<p>"M. Badinot wishes him to take this letter to its
address instantly. There's no answer, but it is in great
haste."</p>

<p>"In a quarter of an hour he will be on his way
thither, madame."</p>

<p>"He must make great haste."</p>

<p>"He shall, be assured."</p>

<p>The servant went away.</p>

<p>"Is she the maid of one of your lodgers, Father
Micou?"</p>

<p>"She is the <i>bonne</i> of my independent lady, Madame
Saint-Ildefonse. But M. Badinot is her uncle; he came
from the country yesterday," said the respectable Micou,
who was looking at the letter, and then added, reading
the address, "Look, now, what grand acquaintances!
Why, I told you they were high folks; he writes to a
viscount."</p>

<p>"Oh, bah!"</p>

<p>"See here, then, 'To Monsieur the Vicomte de Saint-Remy,
Rue de Chaillot. In great haste. Private.' I
hope, when we lodge independent persons who have
uncles who write to viscounts, we may allow some few
of our other lodgers higher up in the house to be
without passports, eh?"</p>

<p>"I believe you. Well, then, Father Micou, we shall
soon be back. I shall fasten my dog and cart to your
door, and carry what I have; so be ready with the
goods and the money, so that I may cut at once."</p>

<p>"I'll be ready. Four good iron plates, each two feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
square, three bars of iron two feet long, and two hinges
for your valve. This valve seems very odd to me; but
it's no affair of mine. Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and my money?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you shall have your money. But now I look at
you in the light&mdash;now I get a good view of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;but you seem as if something was
the matter."</p>

<p>"I do?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! If anything ails me it is that I'm
hungry."</p>

<p>"You're hungry? Like enough; but it rather looks
as if you wanted to appear very lively, whilst all the
while there's something that worries you; and it must
be <i>something</i>, for it ain't a trifle that puts you
out."</p>

<p>"I tell you you're mistaken, Father Micou," said
Nicholas, shuddering.</p>

<p>"Why, you quite tremble!"</p>

<p>"It's my arm that pains me."</p>

<p>"Well, don't forget my prescription, that will cure
you."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, I'll soon be back." And the ruffian went
on his way.</p>

<p>The receiver, after having concealed the lumps of
copper behind his counter, occupied himself in collecting
the various things which Nicholas had requested, when
another individual entered his shop. It was a man
about fifty years of age, with a keen, sagacious face, a
thick pair of gray whiskers, and gold spectacles. He
was extremely well dressed; the wide sleeves of his
brown paletot, with black velvet cuffs, showing his hands
covered with thin coloured kid gloves, and his boots
bore evidence of having been on the previous evening
highly polished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>It was M. Badinot, the independent lady's uncle, that
Madame Saint-Ildefonse, whose social position formed
the pride and security of Père Micou. The reader may,
perchance, recollect that M. Badinot, the former attorney,
struck off that respectable list, then a Chevalier
d'Industrie, and agent in equivocal matters, was the spy
of Baron de Graün, and had given that diplomatist
many and very precise particulars as to many personages
connected with this tale.</p>

<p>"Madame Charles has just given you a letter to
send?" said M. Badinot, to the dealer in <i>et ceteras</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; my nephew I expect every moment, and
he shall go directly."</p>

<p>"No, give me the letter again, I have changed my
mind. I shall go myself to the Comte de Saint-Remy,"
said M. Badinot, pronouncing this aristocratic name very
emphatically, and with much importance.</p>

<p>"Here's the letter, sir; have you any other commission?"</p>

<p>"No, Père Micou," said M. Badinot, with a protecting
air, "but I have something to scold you about."</p>

<p>"Me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Very much, indeed."</p>

<p>"About what, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, Madame de Saint-Ildefonse pays very expensively
for your first floor. My niece is a lodger to whom
the greatest respect ought to be paid; she came highly
recommended to your house, and, having a great aversion
to the noise of carriages, she hoped she should be
here as if she were in the country."</p>

<p>"So she is; it is quite like a village here. You ought
to know, sir,&mdash;you who live in the country,&mdash;this is a
real village."</p>

<p>"A village! Very like, indeed! Why, there is always
such an infernal din in the house."</p>

<p>"Still, it is impossible to find a quieter house. Above
the lady, there is the leader of the band at the Café des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Aveugles, and a gentleman traveller; over that, another
traveller; over that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not alluding to those persons; they are very
quiet, and appear very respectable. My niece has no
fault to find with them; but in the fourth, there is a
stout lame man, whom Madame de Saint-Ildefonse met
yesterday tipsy on the stairs; he was shrieking like a
savage, and she nearly had a fit, she was so much
alarmed. If you think that, with such lodgers, your
house resembles a village&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir, I assure you I only wait the opportunity to turn
this stout lame man out-of-doors; he has paid his last
fortnight in advance, otherwise I should already have
turned him out."</p>

<p>"You should not have taken in such a lodger."</p>

<p>"But, except him, I hope madame has nothing to
complain of. There is a twopenny postman, who is the
cream of honest fellows, and overhead, beside the chamber
of the stout lame man, a lady and daughter, who do
not move any more than dormice."</p>

<p>"I repeat, Madame de Saint-Ildefonse only complains
of this stout lame man, who is the nightmare of the
house; and I warn you that, if you keep such a fellow
in your house, you will find all your respectable lodgers
leave you."</p>

<p>"I will send him away, you may be assured. I have
no wish to keep him."</p>

<p>"You will only do what's right, for else your house
will be forsaken."</p>

<p>"Which will not answer my purpose at all; so, sir,
consider the stout lame man as gone, for he has only
four more days to stay here."</p>

<p>"Which is four days too many; but it is your
affair. At the first outbreak, my niece leaves your
house."</p>

<p>"Be assured, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is all for your own interest,&mdash;and look to it, for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
am not a man of many words," said M. Badinot, with a
patronising air, and he went out.</p>

<p>Need we say that this female and her young daughter,
who lived so lonely, were the two victims of the notary's
cupidity? We will now conduct the reader to the miserable
retreat in which they lived.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h5>THE VICTIMS OF MISPLACED CONFIDENCE.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h5>


<p>Let the reader picture to himself a small chamber on
the fourth floor of the wretched house in the Passage de
la Brasserie. Scarcely could the faint glimmers of early
morn force their pale rays through the narrow casements
forming the only window to this small apartment; the
three panes of glass that apology for a window contained
were cracked and almost the colour of horn, a dingy and
torn yellow paper adhered in some places to the walls,
while from each corner of the cracked ceiling hung long
and thick cobwebs; and to complete the appearance of
wretchedness so evident in this forlorn spot, the flooring
was broken away, and, in many places, displayed the
beams which supported it, as well as the lath and plaster
forming the ceiling of the room beneath. A deal
table, a chair, an old trunk, without hinges or lock, a
truckle-bed, with a wooden headboard, covered by a thin
mattress, coarse sheets of unbleached cloth, and an old
rug,&mdash;such was the entire furniture of this wretched
chamber.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> "The average punishment awarded to such as are convicted of breach
of trust is two months' imprisonment and a fine of twenty-five francs."&mdash;<i>Art.
406 and 408 of the "Code Penal."</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>On the chair sat the Baroness de Fermont, and in the
bed reposed her daughter, Claire de Fermont. Such were
the names of these two victims of the villainy of Jacques
Ferrand. Possessing but one bed, the mother and child
took it by turns to sleep. Too much uneasiness and too
many bitter cares prevented Madame de Fermont from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
enjoying the blessing of repose; but her daughter's
young and elastic nature easily yielded to the natural impulse
which made her willingly seek in short slumbers a
temporary respite from the misery by which she was
surrounded during her waking hours. At the present
moment she was sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>Nothing could be imagined more touchingly affecting
than the picture of misery imposed by the avarice of the
notary on two females hitherto accustomed to every comfort,
and surrounded in their native city by that respect
which is ever felt for honourable and honoured families.</p>

<p>Madame de Fermont was about six and thirty years of
age, with a countenance at once expressive of gentleness
and intelligence, mingled with an indescribably noble and
majestic air. Her features, which had once boasted
extreme beauty, were now pale and careworn; her dark
hair was separated on her forehead, and formed two
thick, lustrous bandeaux, which, after shading her pallid
countenance, were twisted in with her back hair, whose
tresses the hand of sorrow had already mingled with
gray. Dressed in an old shabby black dress, patched
and pieced in various places, Madame de Fermont, her
head supported by her hand, was surveying her child
with looks of ineffable tenderness.</p>

<p>Claire was but sixteen years of age, and her gentle and
innocent countenance, thin and sorrowful as that of her
mother, looked still more pallid as contrasted with the
coarse, unbleached linen which covered her bolster, filled
only with sawdust. The once brilliant complexion of the
poor girl had sickened beneath the privations she endured;
and, as she slept, the long, dark lashes which
fringed her large and lustrous eyes stood out almost unnaturally
upon her sunken cheek; the once fresh and
rosy lips were now dry, cracked, and colourless, yet, half
opened as they were, they displayed the faultless regularity
of her pearly teeth.</p>

<p>The harsh contact of the rough linen which covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
her bed had caused a temporary redness about the neck,
shoulders, and arms of the poor girl, whose fine and
delicate skin was marbled and spotted by the friction
both of the miserable sheets and rug. A sensation of
uneasiness and discomfort seemed to pervade even her
slumbers; for the clearly defined eyebrows, occasionally
contracted, as though the sleeper were under the influence
of an uneasy dream, and the pained expression
observable on the features, foretold the deadly nature of
the disease at work within.</p>

<p>Madame de Fermont had long ceased to find relief in
tears, but, like her suffering daughter, she found that
weakness, languor, and dejection, which is ever the precursor
of severe illness, rapidly and daily increasing;
but, unwilling to alarm Claire, and wishing, if possible,
even to conceal the frightful truth from herself, the
wretched mother struggled against the first approaches
of her malady, while, from a similar feeling of devotion
and affection, Claire sought to hide from her parent the
extreme suffering she herself experienced.</p>

<p>To attempt to describe the tortures endured by the
tender mother, as, during the greater part of the night,
she watched her slumbering child, her thoughts alternately
dwelling on the past, the present, and the future,
would be to paint the sharpest, bitterest, wildest agony
that ever crossed the brain of a loving and despairing
mother; to give alternately her reminiscences of bygone
happiness, her shuddering dread of impending evil, her
fearful anticipations, her bitter regrets, and utter despondency,
mingled with bursts of frenzied rage against the
author of all her sorrows, vain supplications, eager, earnest
prayers, ending at last fearfully and dreadfully in
openly expressed mistrust of the omnipotence and justice
of the Great Being who could thus remain insensible to
the cry which arose from a mother's breaking heart,
to that holy plea whose sound should reach the throne
of grace,&mdash;"Pity, pity, for my child!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"How cold she is!" cried the poor mother, lightly
touching with her icy hand the equally chill arm of her
child; "how very, very cold! and scarcely an hour ago
just as hot! Alas, 'tis the cruel fever which has seized
upon her! Happily the dear creature is as yet unconscious
of her malady! Gracious heaven, she is becoming
cold as death itself! What shall I do to bring warmth
to her poor frame? The bed-coverings are so slight! A
good thought! I will throw my old shawl over her.
But no, no! I dare not remove it from the door over
which I have hung it, lest those men so brutally intoxicated
should endeavour, as they did yesterday, to look
into the room through the disjointed panels or openings
in the framework.</p>

<p>"What a horrible place we have got into! Oh, if I
had but known by what description of persons it was
inhabited before I paid the fortnight in advance! Certainly,
we would not have remained here. But, alas, I
knew it not; and when we have no vouchers for our
respectability, it is so difficult to obtain furnished lodgings.
Who could ever have thought I should have been
at a loss,&mdash;I who quitted Angers in my own carriage,
deeming it unfit my daughter should travel by any
public conveyance? How could I have imagined that
I should experience any difficulty in obtaining every
requisite testimonial of my honour and honesty?"</p>

<p>Then bursting into a fit of anger, she exclaimed,
"'Tis too, too hard, that because this unprincipled,
hard-hearted notary chooses to strip us of all our
possessions, I have no means of punishing him! Yes;
had I money I might sue him legally for his misconduct.
But would not that be to bring obloquy and
contempt on the memory of my good, my noble-minded
brother; to have it publicly proclaimed that he consummated
his ruin by taking away his own life, after
having squandered my fortune and that of my child;
to hear him accused of reducing us to want and wretchedness?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Oh, never,&mdash;never! Still, however dear and
sacred is the memory of a brother, should not the welfare
of my child be equally so?</p>

<p>"And wherefore, too, should I give rise to useless
tales of family misery, unprovided as I am with any
proofs against the notary? Oh, it is, indeed, a cruel,&mdash;a
most cruel case. Sometimes, too, when irritated,
goaded by my reflections almost to madness, I find
myself indulging in bitter plaints against my brother,
and think his conduct more culpable than even the
notary's, as though it were any alleviation of my woes
to have two names to execrate instead of one. But
quickly do I blush at my own base and unworthy suspicions
of one so good, so honourable, so noble-minded
as my poor brother! This infamous notary knows not
all the fearful consequences of his dishonesty. He
fancies he has but taken from us our worldly goods,
while he has plunged a dagger in the hearts of two
innocent, unoffending victims, condemned by his villainy
to die by inches. Alas, I dare not breathe into the ear
of my poor child the full extent of my fears, lest her
young mind should be unable to support the blow!</p>

<p>"But I am ill,&mdash;very, very ill; a burning fever is in
my veins; and 'tis only with the greatest energy and
resolution I contrive to resist its approaches. But too
certainly do I feel aware that the germs of a possibly
mortal disease are in me. I am aware of its gaining
ground hourly. My throat is parched, my head burns
and throbs with racking pains. These symptoms are
even more dangerous than I am willing to own even to
myself. Merciful God! If I were to be ill,&mdash;seriously,
fatally ill,&mdash;if I should die! But no, no!" almost
shrieked Madame Fermont, with wild excitement; "I
cannot,&mdash;I will not die! To leave Claire at sixteen
years of age, alone, and without resource, in the midst
of Paris! Impossible! Oh, no, I am not ill; I have
mistaken the effects of sorrow, cold, and want of rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
for the precursory symptoms of illness. Any person
similarly placed would have experienced the same. It
is nothing, nothing worth noticing. There must be no
weakness on my part. 'Tis by yielding to such dismal
anticipations that one becomes really attacked by the
very malady we dread. And besides, I have not time
to be ill. Oh, no! On the contrary, I must immediately
exert myself to find employment for Claire and myself,
since the wretch who gave us the prints to colour has
dared to&mdash;"</p>

<p>After a short silence, Madame de Fermont, leaving
her last sentence unfinished, indignantly added:</p>

<p>"Horrible idea! To ask the shame of my child in
return for the work he doles out to us, and to harshly
withdraw it because I will not suffer my poor Claire to
go to his house unaccompanied, and work there during
the evening alone with him! Possibly I may succeed
in obtaining work elsewhere, either in plain or ornamental
needlework. Yet it is so very difficult when we
are known to no one; and very recently I tried in vain.
Persons are afraid of entrusting their materials to those
who live in such wretched lodgings as ours. And yet I
dare not venture upon others more creditable; for what
would become of us were the small sum we possess once
exhausted? What could we do? We should be utterly
penniless; as destitute as the veriest beggar that ever
walked the earth.</p>

<p>"And then to think I once was among the richest and
wealthiest! Oh, let me not think of what has been;
such considerations serve but to increase the already
excited state of my brain. It will madden me to recollect
the past; and I am wrong&mdash;oh, very wrong&mdash;thus
to dwell on ideas that sadden and depress instead of
raising and invigorating my enfeebled mind. Had I
gone on thus weakly indulging regrets, I might, indeed,
have fallen ill,&mdash;for I am by no means so at present.
No, no," continued the unfortunate parent, placing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
fingers upon the wrist of her left hand, "my fever has
left me,&mdash;my pulse beats tranquilly."</p>

<p>Alas! the quick, irregular, and hurried pulsation
perceptible beneath the parched yet icy skin allowed
not of such flattering hopes; and, after pausing in deep
and heartfelt wretchedness for a short space, the unhappy
Madame de Fermont thus continued:</p>

<p>"Wherefore, O God of Mercies, thus visit with thine
anger two wretched and helpless creatures, utterly unconscious
of having merited thy displeasure? What
has been the crime that has thus drawn down such
heavy punishments upon our heads? Was not my child
a model of innocent piety, as her father was of honour?
Have I not ever scrupulously fulfilled my duties both as
wife and mother? Why, then, permit us to become the
victims of a vile, ignoble wretch,&mdash;my sweet, my innocent
child more especially? Oh, when I remember that,
but for the nefarious conduct of this notary, the rising
dawn of my daughter's existence would have been clear
and unclouded, I can scarcely restrain my tears. But
for his base treachery we should now be in our own
home, without further care or sorrow than such as arose
from the painful and unhappy circumstances attending
the death of my poor brother. In two or three years'
time I should have begun to think of marrying my sweet
Claire, that is, if I could have found any one worthy of
so good, so pure-minded, and so lovely a creature as
herself. Who would not have rejoiced in obtaining such
a bride? And further, after having merely reserved to
myself a trifling annuity, sufficient to have enabled me
to live somewhere in the neighbourhood, I intended, on
her marriage, to bestow on her the whole of my remaining
possessions, amounting to at least one hundred
thousand crowns; for I should have been enabled to
lay by something. And, when a lovely and beautiful
young creature, like my Claire, gifted with all the
advantages of a superior education, can, in addition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
boast of a dowry of more than one hundred thousand
crowns&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, as she again returned to the realities of her
present position, altogether overcome by the painful contrast,
Madame de Fermont exclaimed, almost frantically:</p>

<p>"Still, it is not to be supposed that, because the
notary so wills it, I shall sit tamely by and see my only
and beloved child reduced to the most abject misery,
entitled as she is to a life of the most unalloyed felicity.
If I can obtain no redress from the laws of my country,
I will not permit the infamous conduct of this man to
escape unpunished. For if I am driven to desperation,
if I find no means of extricating my daughter and myself
from the deplorable condition to which the villainy of
this man has brought us, I cannot answer for myself,
or what I may do. I may be driven by madness to
retaliate on this man, even by taking his life. And
what if I did, after all I have endured, after all the
scalding tears he has caused me to shed, who could
blame me? At least I should be secure of the pity and
sympathy of all mothers who loved their children as I
do my Claire. Yes; but, then, what would be her
position,&mdash;left alone, friendless, unexperienced, and
destitute? Oh, no, no, that is my principal dread;
therefore do I fear to die.</p>

<p>"And for that same reason dare I not harm the traitor
who has wrought our ruin. What would become of her
at sixteen?&mdash;pure and spotless as an angel, 'tis true.
But then she is so surpassingly lovely; and want, desolation,
cold, and misery are fearful things to oppose alone
and unaided. How fearful a conflict might be presented
to one of her tender years, and into how terrible an
abyss might she not fall? Oh, want,&mdash;fatal word! As
I trace it, a crowd of sickening images rise before me,
and distract my senses. Destitution, dreadful as it is
to all, is still more formidable to those who have lived
surrounded not only with every comfort, but even luxury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
One thing I cannot pardon myself for, and that is that,
in the face of all these overwhelming trials, I have not
yet been able to subdue my unfortunate pride; and I
feel persuaded that nothing but the sight of my child,
actually perishing before my eyes for want of bread,
could induce me to beg. How weak, how selfish and
cowardly! Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, as her thoughts wandered to the source of all
her present sufferings and anguish, she mournfully
continued:</p>

<p>"The notary has reduced me to a state of beggary; I
must, therefore, yield to the stern necessity of my situation.
There must be an end of all delicacy as well as
scruples. They might have been well enough in bygone
days; but my duty is now to stretch forth my hand to
solicit charitable aid for both my daughter and myself.
And if I fail in procuring work, I must make up my
mind to implore the charity of my fellow creatures,
since the roguery of the notary has left me no alternative.
Doubtless in that, as in other trades, there is an
art, an expertness to be acquired, and which experience
alone can bestow. Never mind," continued she, with a
sort of feverish wildness, "one must learn one's craft,
and only practice can make perfect. Surely mine must
be a tale to move even the most unfeeling. I have to
tell of misfortunes alike severe and unmerited,&mdash;of an
angelic child, but sixteen years of age, exposed to every
evil of life. But then it requires a practised hand to set
forth all these qualifications, so as best to excite sympathy
and compassion. No matter; I shall manage it,
I feel quite sure. And, after all," exclaimed the half
distracted woman, with a gloomy smile, "what have I
so much to complain of? Fortune is perishable and
precarious; and the notary will, at least, if he has taken
my money, have compelled me to adopt a trade."</p>

<p>For several minutes Madame de Fermont remained
absorbed in her reflections, then resumed more calmly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have frequently thought of inquiring for some situation.
What I seem to covet is just such a place as
a female has here who is servant to a lady living on
the first floor. Had I that situation I might probably
receive wages sufficient to maintain Claire; and I might
even, through the intervention of the mistress I served,
be enabled to obtain occupation for my daughter, who
then would remain here. Neither should I be obliged to
quit her. Oh, what joy, could it be so arranged! But
no, no, that would be happiness too great for me to
expect; it would seem like a dream. And then, again,
if I obtained the place, the poor woman now occupying
it must be turned away. Possibly she is as poor and
destitute as ourselves. Well, what if she be? No
scruple has arisen to save us from being stripped of our
all, and my child's preservation outweighs all fastidious
notions of delicacy in my breast. The only difficulty
consists in obtaining an introduction to the lady on
the first floor, and contriving to dispossess the servant
of a place which would be to me the very perfection of
ease and comfort."</p>

<p>Several loud and hasty knocks at the door startled
Madame de Fermont, and made her daughter spring up
with a sudden cry.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, dear mother," asked poor Claire,
trembling with fear, "what is the matter?" And then,
without giving her agitated parent time to recover herself,
the terrified girl threw her arms around her mother's
neck, as if she sought for safety in that fond, maternal
bosom, while Madame de Fermont, pressing her child
almost convulsively to her breast, gazed with terror at
the door.</p>

<p>"Mamma, mamma," again moaned Claire, "what was
that noise that awoke me? And why do you seem so
much alarmed?"</p>

<p>"I know not, my child, what it was. But calm yourself,
there is nothing to fear; some one merely knocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
at the door,&mdash;possibly to bring us a letter from the
post-office."</p>

<p>At this moment the worm-eaten door shook and
rattled beneath the blows dealt against it by some
powerful fist.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" inquired Madame de Fermont, in a
trembling tone.</p>

<p>A harsh, coarse, and vulgar voice replied, "Holloa,
there! What, are you so deaf there's no making you
hear? Holloa, I say, open your door; and let's have
a look at you. Hip, hip, holloa! Come, sharp's the
word; I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>"I know you not," exclaimed Madame de Fermont,
striving to command herself sufficiently to speak with a
steady voice; "what is it you seek here?"</p>

<p>"Not know me? Why, I'm your opposite neighbour
and fellow lodger, Robin. I want a light for my pipe.
Come, cut about. Whoop, holloa! Don't go to sleep
again, or I must come in and wake you."</p>

<p>"Merciful heavens!" whispered the mother to her
daughter, "'tis that lame man, who is nearly always
intoxicated."</p>

<p>"Now, then, are you going to give me a light?
Because, I tell you fairly, one I will have if I knock
your rickety old door to pieces."</p>

<p>"I have no light to give you."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother and nonsense! If you have no candle
burning you must have the means of lighting one.
Nobody is without a few lucifer matches, be they ever
so poor. Do you or do you not choose to give me a
light?"</p>

<p>"I beg of you to go away."</p>

<p>"You don't choose to open your door, then? Once,&mdash;twice,&mdash;mind,
I will have it."</p>

<p>"I request you to quit my door immediately, or I will
call for assistance."</p>

<p>"Once,&mdash;twice,&mdash;thrice,&mdash;you will not? Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
then, here goes! Now I'll smash your old timbers,
into morsels too small for you to pick up. Hu!&mdash;hu!&mdash;hallo!
Well done! Bravo!"</p>

<p>And suiting the action to the word, the ruffian
assailed the door so furiously that he quickly drove
it in, the miserable lock with which it was furnished
having speedily broken to pieces.</p>

<p>The two women shrieked loudly; Madame de Fermont,
in spite of her weakness, rushed forward to meet
the ruffian at the moment when he was entering the
room, and stopped him.</p>

<p>"Sir, this is most shameful; you must not enter
here," exclaimed the unhappy mother, keeping the door
closed as well as she could. "I will call for help."
And she shuddered at the sight of this man, with his
hideous and drunken countenance.</p>

<p>"What's all this? What's all this?" said he.
"Oughtn't neighbours to be obliging? You ought
to have opened; I shouldn't have broken anything."</p>

<p>Then with the stupid obstinacy of intoxication, he
added, reeling on his tottering legs:</p>

<p>"I wanted to come in, and I will come in; and I
won't go out until I've lighted my pipe."</p>

<p>"I have neither fire nor matches. In heaven's name,
sir, do go away."</p>

<p>"That's not true. You tell me that I may not see
the little girl who's in bed. Yesterday you stopped up
all the holes in the door. She's a pretty chick, and I
should like to see her. So mind, or I shall hurt you if
you don't let me enter quietly. I tell you I will see the
little girl in her bed, and I will light my pipe, or I'll
smash everything before me, and you into the bargain."</p>

<p>"Help, help, help!" exclaimed Madame de Fermont,
who felt the door yielding before the broad shoulders of
the Gros-Boiteux.</p>

<p>Alarmed by her cries, the man retreated a step; and
clenching his fist at Madame de Fermont, he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shall pay me for this, mind. I will come back
to-night and wring your tongue out, and then you can't
squall out."</p>

<p>And the Gros-Boiteux, as he was called at the Isle du
Ravageur, went down the staircase, uttering horrible
threats.</p>

<p>Madame de Fermont, fearing that he might return,
and seeing that the lock was broken, dragged the table
across the room, in order to barricade it. Claire had
been so alarmed, so agitated, at this horrible scene, that
she had fallen on her bed almost senseless, and overcome
by a nervous attack. Her mother, forgetting her own
fears, ran to her, embraced her, gave her a little water
to drink, and by her caresses and attentions revived her.
When she saw her gradually recovering she said to
her:</p>

<p>"Calm yourself; don't be alarmed, my dearest child,
this wicked man has gone." Then the unfortunate
mother exclaimed, in a tone of indescribable indignation
and grief, "And it is that notary who is the first cause
of all our sufferings."</p>

<p>Claire looked about her with as much astonishment as
fear.</p>

<p>"Take courage, my child," said Madame de Fermont,
embracing her tenderly; "the wretch has gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, if he should come back again! You
see, though you cried so loud for help, no one came.
Oh, pray let us leave this house, or I shall die with
fear!"</p>

<p>"How you tremble; you are quite in a fever."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the young girl, to reassure her mother,
"it is nothing&mdash;only fright,&mdash;and that will soon pass
away. And you,&mdash;how do you feel? Give me your
hands. Oh, how they burn! It is, indeed, you who are
suffering; and you try to conceal it from me!"</p>

<p>"Don't think so; I feel better than I did. It is only
the fright that man caused me which makes me so. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
was sleeping soundly in my chair, and only awoke when
you did."</p>

<p>"Yet, mamma, your poor eyes look so red and
inflamed!"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, my dear, one does not sleep so
refreshingly in a chair."</p>

<p>"And you really do not suffer?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I assure you. And you?"</p>

<p>"Nor I either. I only tremble with fear. Pray,
mamma, let us leave this house!"</p>

<p>"And where shall we go to? You know what trouble
we had to find this miserable chamber; for, unfortunately,
we have no papers,&mdash;and, besides, we have paid a fortnight
in advance. They will not return our money; and
we have so very, very little left, that we must take all
possible care of it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps M. de Saint-Remy will answer you in a day
or two."</p>

<p>"I cannot hope for that. It is so long since I wrote
to him."</p>

<p>"He cannot have received your letter. Why did not
you write to him again? From here to Angers is not
so far, and we should soon have his answer."</p>

<p>"My poor child, you know how much that has cost
me already!"</p>

<p>"But there's no risk; and he is so good in spite of
his roughness. Wasn't he one of the oldest friends of
my father? And then he is a relation of ours."</p>

<p>"But he is poor himself,&mdash;his fortune is very small.
Perhaps he does not reply to us that he may avoid the
pain of a refusal."</p>

<p>"But he may not have received your letter, mamma!"</p>

<p>"And if he has received it, my dear,&mdash;one of two
things, either he is himself in too painful a position to
come to our aid, or he feels no interest in us. What,
then, is the use of exposing ourselves to a refusal or
humiliation?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come, courage, mamma; we have still a hope
left. Perhaps this very morning will bring us a kind
answer."</p>

<p>"From M. d'Orbigny?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the letter of which you had made the rough
copy was so simple and touching. It showed our miserable
condition so naturally that he will have pity on us.
Really, I don't know why, but something tells me you
are wrong to despair of him."</p>

<p>"He has so little motive for taking any interest in us.
It is true he formerly knew your father, and I have often
heard my poor brother speak of M. d'Orbigny as a man
with whom he was on good terms before the latter left
Paris to retire into the country with his young
wife."</p>

<p>"It is that which makes me hope. He has a young
wife, and she will be compassionate. And then in the
country one can do so much good. He will take you, I
should think, as a housekeeper, and I could work in the
needle-room. Then M. d'Orbigny is very rich, and in a
great house there is always so much to do."</p>

<p>"Yes; but we have so little claim on his kind
interest!"</p>

<p>"We are so unfortunate!"</p>

<p>"It is true that is a claim in the eyes of charitably
disposed persons."</p>

<p>"Let us hope that M. d'Orbigny and his wife are so."</p>

<p>"Then if we do not have any or an unfavorable
answer from him, I will overcome my false shame, and
write to the Duchesse de Lucenay."</p>

<p>"The lady of whom M. de Saint-Remy has spoken so
often, and whose kindness and generosity he so much,
praised?"</p>

<p>"The same,&mdash;daughter of the Prince de Noirmont.
He knew her when she was very young, and treated her
almost always as if she were his own child, for he was
on terms of the closest intimacy with the prince. Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
de Lucenay must have many acquaintances, and, no doubt,
could easily find situations for us."</p>

<p>"No doubt, mamma. But I understand your delicacy;
you do not know her, whilst, at least, my father
and my uncle both knew a little of M. d'Orbigny."</p>

<p>"Well, but in case Madame de Lucenay cannot do
anything for us, I have still another resource."</p>

<p>"What is that, mamma?"</p>

<p>"A very poor one,&mdash;a very weak hope, perhaps.
But why should I not try it? M. de Saint-Remy's
son is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has M. de Saint-Remy a son?" exclaimed Claire,
interrupting her mother with great astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, he has a son."</p>

<p>"Yet he never spoke of him when he used to come to
Angers."</p>

<p>"True, and, for reasons which you cannot understand,
M. de Saint-Remy, having quitted Paris fifteen
years ago, has not seen his son since that period."</p>

<p>"Fifteen years without seeing his father! Is that
possible?"</p>

<p>"Alas, yes! As you see, the son of M. de Saint-Remy,
being very much sought after in society, and very rich&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very rich, whilst his father is poor?"</p>

<p>"All young M. de Saint-Remy's wealth came from his
mother."</p>

<p>"What of that,&mdash;how could he leave his father?"</p>

<p>"His father would not accept anything from him."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"That is a question to which I cannot reply, my dear
child; but I have heard it said by my poor brother that
this young man was reputed vastly generous. Young
and generous, he ought to be good. Learning from me
that my husband had been his father's intimate friend,
perhaps he will interest himself in trying to find us
work or employment. He has such high and extensive
connections, that this would be no trouble to him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then, perhaps, too, we could learn from him if
M. de Saint-Remy, his father, had not quitted Angers
before you wrote to him: that would account for his
silence."</p>

<p>"I think, my dear, that M. de Saint-Remy has not
kept up any connection with&mdash;Still, we cannot but try."</p>

<p>"Unless M. d'Orbigny replies to you favourably, and
I repeat, I don't know why, but I have hopes, in spite of
myself."</p>

<p>"It is now many days, my dear, since I wrote to him,
telling him all the causes of our misfortunes, and yet to
this time we have no reply,&mdash;none. A letter put in the
post before four o'clock in the evening reaches Aubiers
next morning, and thus we might have had his answer
five days ago."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, before he replies, he is considering in what
way he can best be useful to us."</p>

<p>"May Heaven hear thee, my child!"</p>

<p>"It appears to me plain enough, mamma, if he could
not do anything for us, he could have written at once,
and said so."</p>

<p>"Unless he will do nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, is that possible? to refuse to answer
us, and leave us in hope for four days&mdash;eight days,
perhaps; for when one is miserable we always hope."</p>

<p>"Alas, my child, there is sometimes so much indifference
for the miseries persons have never known!"</p>

<p>"But your letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My letter cannot give him any idea of our actual
disquietude, our constant sufferings; my letter will not
depict to him our unhappy life, our constant humiliations,
our existence in this horrid house,&mdash;the fright we have
but this instant experienced. My letter will not describe
the horrible future which is in store for us, if&mdash;But,
my love, do not let us talk of that. You tremble,&mdash;you
are cold."</p>

<p>"No, mamma, don't mind me; but tell me, suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
all fails us, the little money we have in the box is spent,&mdash;is
it possible that, in a city as rich as Paris, we shall
both die of hunger and misery&mdash;for want of work, and
because a wicked man has taken from you all you had
in the world?"</p>

<p>"Oh, be silent, my unfortunate child!"</p>

<p>"But really, mamma, is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Alas!"</p>

<p>"But God, who knows all, who can do all, will he
abandon us, who have never offended him?"</p>

<p>"I entreat you, my dearest girl, do not give way to
these distressing ideas. I would prefer seeing you hope,
without great reason, either. Come, come, comfort me
rather with your consoling ideas; I am but too apt to be
discouraged, as you well know."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, let us hope, that is best. No doubt the
porter's nephew will return to-day from the <i>Poste-Restante</i>
with a letter. Another errand to pay out of your little
stock, and through my fault. If I had not been so weak
yesterday and to-day we should have gone to the post-office
ourselves, as we did the day before yesterday; but
you will not leave me here alone and go yourself."</p>

<p>"How could I, my dear? Only think, just now,
that horrid man who burst open the door! Suppose you
had been alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, pray don't talk of it; it quite frightens
me only to think of it."</p>

<p>At this moment some one knocked suddenly at the
door.</p>

<p>"Heaven, it is he again!" exclaimed Madame de
Fermont, still under her first fears; and she pushed the
table against the door with all her strength. Her fears
ceased when she heard the voice of Father Micou:</p>

<p>"Madame, my nephew, André, has come from the
<i>Poste-Restante</i>. He has brought a letter with an 'X'
and a 'Z.' It comes a long way; there are eight sous
for postage, and commission makes twenty sous."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma, a letter from the country,&mdash;we are saved!
It is from M. de Saint-Remy or M. d'Orbigny. Poor
mother! You will not suffer any more; you will no
longer be uneasy about me, you will be so happy! God
is just! God is good!" exclaimed the young girl, and a
ray of hope lighted up her mild and lovely face.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, thank you; give it to me quickly!" said
Madame de Fermont, moving the table as well as she
could, and half opening the door.</p>

<p>"Twenty sous," said the man, giving her the anxiously
desired letter.</p>

<p>"I will pay you, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, madame, there's no hurry, I am going up higher;
in ten minutes I shall be down again, and can call for the
money as I pass."</p>

<p>"The letter is from Normandy, with the postmark
of 'Les Aubiers.' It is from Madame d'Orbigny!"
exclaimed Madame de Fermont, examining the address,
"To Madame X. Z., <i>Poste-Restante</i>, à Paris."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, am I right? Oh, how my heart
beats!"</p>

<p>"Our good or bad fate is in it," said Madame de Fermont;
and twice her trembling hand was extended to
break the seal; she had not courage.</p>

<p>How can we describe the terrible agony to which they
are a prey who, like Madame de Fermont, expect a letter
which brings them either hope or despair? The burning,
fevered excitement of the player whose last pieces
of gold are hazarded on a card, and who, breathless, with
inflamed eye, awaits for a decisive cast which brings his
ruin or his fortune,&mdash;this emotion, violent as it is, may
perhaps give some idea of the painful anguish of which
we speak. In a second the soul is elevated to the most
radiant hope or relapses into the most mortal discouragement.
According as he hopes to be aided, or fears to be
refused, the unhappy wretch suffers in turn emotions of
a most contrary nature,&mdash;unutterable feelings of happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and gratitude to the generous heart which pities
his miserable condition&mdash;bitter and intense resentment
against selfish indifference!</p>

<p>When it is a question of deserving sufferers, those
who give often would perhaps give always, and those
who always refuse would perhaps give frequently, if they
knew or saw that the hope of benevolent aid or the fear
of a haughty refusal&mdash;that their decision, indeed&mdash;can
excite all that is distressing or encouraging in the hearts
of their petitioners.</p>

<p>"What weakness!" said Madame de Fermont, with a
deep sigh, seating herself by her daughter; "once again,
my poor Claire, our destiny is in this envelope; I burn
with anxiety to know its contents, and yet I dare not
read it. If it be a refusal, alas, it will be soon
enough!"</p>

<p>"And if it be a promise of assistance, then, mamma&mdash;If
this poor little letter contain consoling words, which
shall assure us for the future, by promising us a humble
employment in the establishment of M. d'Orbigny, every
moment lost is a moment of happiness lost,&mdash;is it
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my love; but on the other hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, mamma, you are mistaken; I told you that M.
d'Orbigny had only delayed so long that he might mention
something certain to you. Let me see the letter,
mamma. I am sure I can guess if it is good or bad by
the writing. And I am sure," said Claire, looking at
the letter, "that it is a kind and generous hand, accustomed
to execute benevolence towards those who suffer."</p>

<p>"I entreat you, Claire, not to give way to vain hopes;
for, if you do, I shall not have the courage to open the
letter."</p>

<p>"My dear mother, without opening it, I can tell
you almost word for word what it contains. Listen:
'Madame,&mdash;Your fate and that of your daughter are
so worthy of interest, that I beg you will come to me, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
case you should like to undertake the superintendence of
my house.'"</p>

<p>"Pray, my dearest, I beseech you, do not give way to
vain hopes; the disappointment would be terrible!" said
Madame de Fermont, taking the letter.</p>

<p>"Come, dear mamma," said Claire, smiling, and
excited by one of those feelings of certainty so natural
to her age, "give me the letter; I have courage to
read it!"</p>

<p>"No," said Madame de Fermont, "I will read it! It
is from the Comtesse d'Orbigny."</p>

<p>"So much the better," replied Claire.</p>

<p>"We shall see." And Madame de Fermont read as
follows in a trembling voice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"'<span class="smcap">Madame</span>:&mdash;M. the Comte d'Orbigny, who has been a
great invalid for some time, could not reply to you during my
absence&mdash;'"</p>
</div>

<p>"You see, mamma, it was no one's fault."</p>

<p>"Listen, listen!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'On arriving from Paris this morning, I hasten to write to
you, madame, after having discussed your letter with M. d'Orbigny.
He recollects but very indistinctly the intimacy you
allude to as having subsisted between him and your brother.
As to the name of your husband, madame, it is not unknown to
M. d'Orbigny; but he cannot recall to mind under what circumstances
he has heard it. The spoliation of which you so unhesitatingly
accuse M. Jacques Ferrand, whom we have the happiness
to call our solicitor, is, in the eyes of M. d'Orbigny, a cruel calumny,
whose effects you have by no means calculated upon. My
husband, as well as myself, madame, know and admire the extreme
probity of the respectable and pious individual whom you so
blindly assail; and I am compelled to tell you, madame, that M.
d'Orbigny, whilst he regrets the painful situation in which you
are placed, and the real cause of which it is not his business to
find out, feels it impossible to afford you the assistance requested.
Accept, madame, with the expression of M. d'Orbigny's regrets,
my best compliments.</p>

<p class="sigs">"'<span class="smcap">Comtesse d'Orbigny</span>.'"</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother and daughter looked at each other perfectly
stupefied, and incapable of uttering a word. Father
Micou rapped at the door, and said:</p>

<p>"Madame, may I come in for the postage and commission?
It's twenty sous."</p>

<p>"Ah, true, such good news is worth a sum on which
we exist for two days," said Madame de Fermont, with
a bitter smile, laying the letter down on her daughter's
bed, and going towards an old trunk without a lock, to
which she stooped down and opened. "We are robbed!"
exclaimed the unhappy woman, with alarm. "Nothing&mdash;not
a sou left!" she added, in a mournful voice;
and, overwhelmed, she supported herself on the trunk.</p>

<p>"What do you say, mamma,&mdash;the bag with the money
in it?"</p>

<p>But Madame de Fermont, rising suddenly, opened the
room door, and, addressing the receiver, who was on
the landing-place:</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, whilst her eyes sparkled, and her
cheeks were flushed with indignation and alarm, "I had
a bag of silver in this trunk; it was stolen from me, no
doubt, the day before yesterday, when I went out for an
hour with my daughter. The money must be restored,
I tell you,&mdash;you are responsible for it!"</p>

<p>"You've been robbed! That's false, I know. My
house is respectable," said the fellow, in an insolent and
brutal tone; "you only say that in order not to pay me
my postage and commission."</p>

<p>"I tell you, sir, that this money was all I possessed in
the world; it has been stolen from me, and I must have
it found and restored, or I will lodge an information.
Oh, I will conceal nothing&mdash;I will respect nothing&mdash;I
tell you!"</p>

<p>"Very fine, indeed! You who have got no papers. Go
and lay your information,&mdash;go at once. Why don't
you? I defy you, I do!"</p>

<p>The wretched woman was thunderstruck. She could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
not go out and leave her daughter alone, confined to her
bed as she was by the fright the Gros-Boiteux had occasioned
her in the morning, and particularly after the
threats with which the receiver of stolen goods had
menaced her. He added:</p>

<p>"This is a fudge! You'd as much a bag of silver there
as a bag of gold. Will you pay me for the letter,&mdash;will
you or won't you? Well, it's just the same to me.
When you go by my door, I'll snatch off your old black
shawl from your shoulders. It's a precious shabby one;
but I daresay I can make twenty sous out of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," exclaimed Madame de Fermont, bursting
into tears, "I beseech you have pity upon us! This
small sum is all we possess, my daughter and I, and,
that stolen, we have nothing left&mdash;nothing&mdash;I say
nothing, but&mdash;to die of starvation!"</p>

<p>"What can I do? If it's true that you have been
robbed, and of silver, too (which appears to me very unlikely),
why, the silver has been melted long since, rely
on it."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!</i>"</p>

<p>"The chap who did the trick was not so soft, rely on
it, as to mark the pieces, and keep 'em here, to lead to
his own detection. Supposing it's any one in the house,
which I don't believe (for, as I was a-saying this morning
to the uncle of the lady on the first floor, this is
really a village), if any one has robbed you, it is a pity.
You may lay a hundred informations, but you won't recover
a centime. You won't do any good by that, I tell
you, and you may believe me. Well, but I say&mdash;" exclaimed
the receiver, stopping short, and seeing Madame
de Fermont stagger. "What's the matter? How pale
you are! Mademoiselle, your mother's taken ill!"
added Micou, just advancing in time to catch the unhappy
mother, who, overcome by this last shock, felt
her senses forsake her,&mdash;the forced energy which had
supported her so long failed before this fresh blow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother, dear, oh, what ails you?" exclaimed
Claire, still in her bed.</p>

<p>The receiver, still vigorous in spite of his fifty years,
seized with a momentary feeling of pity, took Madame
de Fermont in his arms, pushed the door open with his
knee, and, entering the chamber, said:</p>

<p>"Your pardon, mademoiselle, for entering whilst you
are in bed, but I was obliged to bring in your mother;
she has fainted, but it won't last long."</p>

<p>On seeing the man enter, Claire shrieked loudly, and
the unhappy girl hid herself as well as she could under
the bedclothes. The huckster seated Madame de Fermont
in a chair beside the bed, and then went out, leaving
the door ajar, for the Gros-Boiteux had broken the
lock.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>One hour after this last shock, the violent malady
which had so long hung over and threatened Madame de
Fermont had developed itself. A prey to a burning
fever and to fearful delirium, the unhappy woman was
placed beside her daughter, who, horror-struck, aghast,
alone, and almost as ill as her mother, had neither money
nor recourse, and was in an agony of fear every moment
lest the ruffian who lodged on the same floor should
enter the apartment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h5>THE RUE DE CHAILLOT.</h5>


<p>We will precede M. Badinot by some hours, as in haste
he proceeded from the Passage de la Brasserie to the
Vicomte de Saint-Remy. The latter, as we have said,
lived in the Rue de Chaillot, and occupied a delightful
small house, built between the court and the garden in
this quarter, so solitary, although so close to the Champs
Elysées, the most fashionable promenade in Paris.</p>

<p>It is useless to enumerate the advantages which M. de
Saint-Remy, who was decidedly a man <i>à bonnes fortunes</i>,
derived from the position of a residence so sagaciously
selected. We will only say that a gentleman (or a lady)
could enter very privately by a small door in the large
garden which opened into a back lane absolutely deserted,
communicating from the Rue Marboeuf to the Rue de
Chaillot. By wonderful chance, one of the finest nursery-grounds
in Paris having also in this quiet passage a
way out that was little frequented, the mysterious visitors
of M. de Saint-Remy, in case of a surprise or sudden
rencounter, were armed with a most plausible and
bucolical excuse for their visit to the lonely alley: they
were there (they might say if they pleased) to choose
some rare flowers from the celebrated gardener who was
so renowned for the beauty of his conservatories. The
visitors need only thus tell half falsehoods; for the vicomte,
plentifully imbued with all the tastes of most
costly luxuries, had a delightful greenhouse, which extended
along the side of the alley we have alluded to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
The small private door opened on this delightful winter
garden, which terminated in a boudoir (forgive the superannuated
expression), which was on the ground floor
of the house.</p>

<p>We may say, therefore, without metaphor, that a
female who passed this dangerous threshold, to enter
M. de Saint-Remy's house, ran to her ruin through a
flowery path; for, in the winter particularly, this lonely
alley was bordered with real bushes of bright and perfumed
flowers. Madame de Lucenay, jealous as a woman
deeply in love always is, had demanded the key of this
small door.</p>

<p>If we dwell somewhat on the general aspect of this
dwelling, it is that it reflected (if we may be allowed
the expression) one of those degrading existences which
from day to day become happily more rare, but which
it may be as well to note down as one of the peculiarities
of the epoch.</p>

<p>The interior of M. de Saint-Remy's house presented
(viewed in this light) a curious appearance, or rather
the house was separated into two distinct zones,&mdash;the
ground floor, where he received his female visitors; the
first story, where he received his gambling companions
or his dinner or hunting associates; in a word, what he
called his friends. Thus on the ground floor was a bedchamber,
which was nothing but gold, mirrors, flowers,
satin, and lace; then a small music-room, in which was
a harp and piano (M. de Saint-Remy was an excellent
musician); a cabinet of pictures; and then the boudoir,
which communicated with the conservatory; a dining-room
for two persons, who were served and passed away
the dishes and plates by a turning window; a bath-room,
a model of luxury and Oriental refinement; and, close
at hand, a small library, a portion of which was arranged
after the catalogue of that which La Mettrie had collected
for Frederic the Great. Such was this apartment.</p>

<p>It would be unavailing to say that all these rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
furnished with exquisite taste, and with a Sardanapalian
luxury, had as ornaments Watteaus little known; Bouchers
never engraved; wanton subjects, formerly purchased at
enormous prices. There were, besides, groups modelled
in terra-cotta, by Clodien, and here and there, on plinths
of jasper or antique breccia, some rare copies, in white
marble, of the most jovial and lovely bacchanals of the
Secret Museum of Naples.</p>

<p>Add to this, in summer there were in perspective the
green recesses of a well-planted garden, lonely, replete
with flowers and birds, watered by a small and sparkling
fountain, which, before it spread itself on the verdant
turf, fell from a black and shaggy rock, scintillated like a
strip of silver gauze, and dashed into a clear basin like
mother-of-pearl, where beautiful white swans wantoned
with grace and freedom.</p>

<p>Then, when the mild and serene night came on, what
shade, what perfume, what silence, was there in those
odorous clumps, whose thick foliage served as a dais for
the rustic seats formed of reeds and Indian mats.</p>

<p>During the winter, on the contrary, except the glass
door which opened to the hothouse, all was kept close
shut. The transparent silk of the blinds, the net lace of
the curtains, made the daylight still more mysterious.
On all the pieces of furniture large tufts of exotic plants
seemed to put forth their large flowers, resplendent with
gold and enamel.</p>

<p>In order to do the honours of this temple, which
seemed raised to antique Love, or the denuded divinities
of Greece, behold a man, young, handsome, elegant,
and distinguished,&mdash;by turns witty and tender, romantic
or libertine; now jesting and gay to folly, now full of
charm and grace; an excellent musician, gifted with
one of those impassioned, vibrating voices which women
cannot hear without experiencing a deep impression,
almost physical,&mdash;in fact, a man essentially made for
love,&mdash;such was the vicomte. In Athens, no doubt, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
would have been admired, exalted, deified, as was Alcibiades;
in our days, and at the period of which we write,
the vicomte was nothing more than a base forger, a contemptible
swindler.</p>

<p>The first story of M. de Saint-Remy's house was
exceedingly masculine in its whole appearance. It was
there he received his many friends, all of whom were of
the very highest society. There was nothing effeminate,
nothing coquettish. The furniture was plain, but elegant,
the ornaments being first-rate weapons of all sorts, pictures
of race-horses, who had won for the vicomte a
great number of magnificent gold and silver vases,
which were placed on the tables and sideboards.</p>

<p>The smoking-room and play-room were closed by a
cheerful dining-room, where eight persons (the number
to which the guests were rigidly confined when there
was a first-class dinner) had often appreciated the
excellence of the cook, and the no less high merit of
the wine of the vicomte, before they faced him at some
high game of whist for five or six hundred louis, or shook
the noisy dice-box at infernal hazard or roulette.</p>

<p>These two widely opposite shades of M. de Saint-Remy
disclosed, the reader will follow us into the regions below,
to the very comfortable apartment of Edwards Patterson,
the master of the horse of M. de Saint-Remy, who had
invited M. Boyer to breakfast. A very pretty English
maid-servant having withdrawn after she had brought
in the silver teapot, these two worthies remained alone.</p>

<p>Edwards was about forty years of age, and never
did more skilful or stouter coachman make a seat
groan under his most imposing rotundity; never did
powdered wig enclose a more rubicund visage; and
never did a more knowing and competent driver hold
in his four fingers and thumb the reins of a four-in-hand.
As good a judge of a horse as Tattersal (and in his
youth he had been as good a trainer as the old and
celebrated Chiffney), Edwards had been to the vicomte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
a most excellent coachman, and a man perfectly capable
of superintending the training of race-horses on which
he had betted heavily.</p>

<p>When he did not assume his sumptuous brown and
silver livery on the emblazoned hammercloth of his box,
Edwards very much resembled an honest English farmer;
and it is under this aspect that we shall present him to
the reader, adding, at the same time, that beneath this
round and red visage there lurked all the pitiless and
devilish cunning of the horse-dealer.</p>

<p>M. Boyer, his guest, the confidential servant of the
vicomte, was a tall, thin man, with gray, smooth hair,
bald forehead, cunning glance, with a countenance calm,
discreet, and reserved. He expressed himself in somewhat
choice phraseology, with polite, easy manners; he
was tolerably well informed, his political opinions being
legitimist, and he could take his part as first violin in an
amateur quartette. From time to time, and with the
best air in the world, he took a pinch of snuff from a
gold snuff-box, set around with fine pearls, after which
he negligently shook with the back of his hand (as white
and carefully attended to as his master's) the particles
of snuff from the frill of his fine Holland shirt.</p>

<p>"Do you know, my dear Edwards," said Boyer, "that
your maid, Betty, really does your meals in a very fair
manner! <i>Ma foi!</i> now and then one gets tired of high
living."</p>

<p>"The fact is that Betty is a very good girl," said
Edwards, who spoke very good French. "I shall take
her with me into my establishment, if I make up my
mind to set up in housekeeping; and on this point, since
we are alone, my dear Boyer, let us talk of business
matters which you know as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, tolerably," said Boyer, modestly taking a
pinch of snuff, "one learns them so naturally, when they
are the affairs of others that occupy us."</p>

<p>"I want your advice on a very important point, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
that's the reason I have begged you to come and take a
cup of tea with me."</p>

<p>"I'm at your service, my dear Edwards."</p>

<p>"You know that, besides the race-horses, I had an
agreement with M. le Vicomte to the complete providing
of his stable, horses, and men, that is to say, eight horses
and five or six grooms and boys, for twenty-four thousand
francs (nine thousand guineas) a year, including my
wages."</p>

<p>"That was moderate enough."</p>

<p>"For four years M. le Vicomte paid me very regularly;
but about the middle of last year he said to me,
'Edwards, I owe you about twenty-four thousand francs.
What value, at the lowest, do you set on my horses and
carriages?' 'Monsieur le Vicomte, the eight horses
ought to fetch three thousand francs (120<i>l.</i>) each, one
with another, and that would make (and it's true, Boyer,
for the pair of phaeton horses cost five hundred guineas)
exactly twenty-four thousand francs for the horses. As
to the carriages, there are four, let us say, for twelve
thousand francs; that, added to the twenty-four thousand
francs for the horses, makes thirty-six thousand francs.'
'Well,' replied the vicomte, 'buy the whole of me at
that price, on condition that for the twelve thousand
francs which you will owe me, paid as it were in advance,
you shall keep and place at my disposal horses, servants,
and carriages for six months.'"</p>

<p>"And you very wisely acceded to the proposal, Edwards?
It was a golden gain to you."</p>

<p>"No doubt. In another fortnight the six months will
have expired, and I become proprietor of the horses and
carriages."</p>

<p>"Nothing plainer. The agreement was drawn up by
M. Badinot, the vicomte's man of business, what do you
want with my advice?"</p>

<p>"What should I do? To sell the horses and carriages
in consequence of M. le Vicomte's departure? All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
would sell well, as he is known as one of the first judges
in Paris; or ought I to set up as a horse-dealer with my
stud, which would make a capital beginning? What
is your opinion&mdash;your advice?"</p>

<p>"I advise you to do what I shall do myself."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"I am in the same position as yourself."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"M. le Vicomte detests details. When I entered in
his service I had, by savings and inheritance, sixty thousand
francs (2,400<i>l.</i>). I paid the expenses of the house
as you did of the stables; and every year M. le Vicomte
paid me without examining my account. At nearly the
same time as yourself I found myself out of pocket
about twenty thousand francs on my own account, and,
to the tradespeople, sixty thousand francs. Then M. le
Vicomte made me the same proposition as to yourself,
in order to reimburse me. I was to sell the furniture
of the house, including the plate, which is very handsome,
very fine paintings, etc., the whole estimated
at a hundred and forty thousand francs (5,600<i>l.</i>). There
were eighty thousand francs to pay, and there remained
sixty thousand francs which I was to disburse until they
were quite exhausted, in the expenses of the table, the
servants' wages, etc., and in nothing else. These were
the terms of the agreement."</p>

<p>"Because on that outlay you have a profit."</p>

<p>"As a matter of course; for I made all the agreements
with the tradespeople, whom I shall not pay until
after the sale," said Boyer, taking a huge pinch of snuff;
"so that at the end of this month&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The furniture is yours, as the horses and carriages
are mine."</p>

<p>"Precisely so. M. le Vicomte has gained by this, by
living for the last few months as he likes to live, <i>en
grand seigneur</i>,&mdash;and that in the very teeth of his
creditors; for furniture, plate, horses, carriages, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
had all been paid for ready money when he came of
age, have now become the property of yourself and
myself."</p>

<p>"And so M. le Vicomte is really ruined?"</p>

<p>"In five years."</p>

<p>"And M. le Vicomte inherited&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only a miserable million (40,000<i>l.</i>), ready money,"
said M. Boyer, with a disdainful air, and taking a pinch
of snuff. "Add to this two hundred thousand francs
of debts (8,000<i>l.</i>), about&mdash;that's pretty well! It was,
therefore, to tell you, my dear Edwards, that I had an
intention of letting this house, so admirably furnished as
it is, to some English family, linen, glass, china, silver,
conservatory. Some of your country-people would pay
a good rent for it?"</p>

<p>"Unquestionably. Why don't you do so?"</p>

<p>"Why, there's considerable risk, and so I make up
my mind to sell the whole at once. M. le Vicomte is
also known as a connoisseur in first-class furniture and
objects of art, so that anything that he has selected
will always fetch double its value, and I am safe to
realise a large sum. Do as I do, Edwards, and realise&mdash;realise.
Don't risk your profits in speculation. You,
first coachman of M. le Vicomte de Saint-Remy,&mdash;why,
there'll be a competition for you. And yesterday I just
heard of a minor who has recently been emancipated, a
cousin of Madame la Duchesse de Lucenay, the young
Duc de Montbrison, who has just arrived from Italy
with his tutor, and is forming his establishment. Two
hundred and fifty thousand livres of income (10,000<i>l.</i>)
from land, my dear Edwards, two hundred and fifty
thousand livres a year,&mdash;just entering into life,&mdash;twenty
years of age only,&mdash;with all the illusions of
simple confidence, and all the desires of expenditure,&mdash;prodigal
as a prince. I know the steward; and I tell
you, in confidence, he has all but concluded with me as
first <i>valet de chambre</i>. He patronises me,&mdash;the fool!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
And M. Boyer shrugged his shoulders, whilst he inhaled
another large pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>"You hope to get rid of him?"</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu</i>, he is a jackanapes,&mdash;an ass! He places
me there as if he ought not to have any fears of me.
Before two months I shall be in his place."</p>

<p>"Two hundred and fifty thousand livres a year in
land!" replied Edwards, reflecting; "and a young man!
It is a good house?"</p>

<p>"I tell you there is everything to make a man comfortable.
I will speak to my protector for you," said
M. Boyer, with irony. "Take the place; it is a fortune
which has roots to it, and one may hold on by it for a
long time. It is not like the unfortunate million of
M. le Vicomte, a snowball, and nothing else,&mdash;a ray
of a Parisian sun, and that's all. I soon saw that I
should only be a bird of passage here. It's a pity, for
the establishment did us credit; and, to the last moment,
I will serve M. le Vicomte with the respect and esteem
due to him."</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, my dear Boyer, I thank you, and accept
your proposition. And, now I think of it, suppose I
were to propose the stud of M. le Vicomte to this young
duke! It is all ready, and known and admired all over
Paris."</p>

<p>"True, you may make a profitable affair of it."</p>

<p>"And you, why don't you propose to him this house
so admirably fitted up in every way? What could he
find better?"</p>

<p>"Bravo! Edwards, you are a man of sense decidedly;
you have suggested a most excellent idea. We must
ask the vicomte; he is such a good master that he will
not refuse to speak for us to the young duke. He may
say that, as he is going on the legation of Gerolstein, to
which he is attached, he wishes to get rid of his whole
establishment. Let us see. One hundred and sixty
thousand francs for the house furnished, twenty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
francs for plate and pictures, fifty thousand francs
for stable and carriages, that makes two hundred and
thirty thousand francs; and it is a bargain for a young
man who wishes to be set up at once in the first
style."</p>

<p>"And the horses!"</p>

<p>"And the capital table! Gallefroi, his cook, will
leave a hundred times better off than when he came
here first. M. le Vicomte has given him capital instruction,&mdash;has
regularly refined him!"</p>

<p>"They say, too, that M. le Vicomte is such a capital
player?"</p>

<p>"Admirable! Gaining large sums with even more
indifference than he loses them! And yet I never saw
any one lose with better taste!"</p>

<p>"And the women, Boyer,&mdash;the women! Ah, you
could tell a tale! You have the sole <i>entrée</i> to the
apartments of the ground floor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have my secrets as you have yours, my dear
fellow."</p>

<p>"Mine?"</p>

<p>"When M. le Vicomte ran his horses, had you not
your confidences? I will not attack the honesty of the
jockeys of your opponents; but there were reports&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear Boyer, a gentleman never compromises
the reputation of a jockey who is against him,
and has the weakness to listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then a gallant never compromises the reputation
of a woman who has been kind to him. So, I say, let's
keep our secrets, or, rather, the secrets of M. le Vicomte,
my dear Edwards."</p>

<p>"Ah, good! What will he do now?"</p>

<p>"He is going to Germany in a good travelling carriage,
with seven or eight thousand francs, which he
knows when to lay his hand upon. Oh, I have no fears
for the vicomte! He is one of those personages who
always fall on their feet, as they say."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he has no future expectancies?"</p>

<p>"None; for his father has nothing but just enough to
live upon."</p>

<p>"His father?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"M. le Vicomte's father is not dead?"</p>

<p>"He was not dead five or six months ago when M. le
Vicomte wrote to him for some family papers."</p>

<p>"But we never see him here?"</p>

<p>"For reasons good. For fifteen years he has resided
in the country at Angers."</p>

<p>"But M. le Vicomte never visits him?"</p>

<p>"His father?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Have they quarrelled, then?"</p>

<p>"What I am going to tell you is no secret, for I have
it from the old man of business of M. the Prince de
Noirmont."</p>

<p>"Father of Madame de Lucenay?" said Edwards,
with a knowing glance at Boyer, who, appearing not to
understand him, replied coolly:</p>

<p>"Madame la Duchesse de Lucenay is the daughter
of M. the Prince de Noirmont. The father of M. le
Vicomte was bosom friend of the prince. Madame la
Duchesse was then very young, and M. de Saint-Remy,
senior, who was very fond of her, treated her as if she
were his own child. I learnt these details from Simon,
the prince's man of business; and I may speak unhesitatingly,
for the adventure I am about to narrate to you
was, at the time, the talk of all Paris. In spite of his
sixty years, the father of M. le Vicomte is a man of
iron disposition, with the courage of a lion, of probity
which I call almost fabulous. He had scarcely any
property of his own, and had married the vicomte's
mother for love. She was a young person of good
fortune, possessing about a million of francs, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
melting of which we have had the honour to be present."
And M. Boyer bowed. Edwards imitated him.</p>

<p>"The marriage was a very happy one, until the
moment when the father of M. le Vicomte found&mdash;accidentally,
as they say&mdash;some letters, which proved
that, during one of his absences three or four years
after his marriage, his wife had had an attachment for
a certain Polish count."</p>

<p>"That often happens to these Poles. When I was
at the Marquis de Senneval's, the marquise, a regular
she-devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Edwards," interrupted M. Boyer, "you
should learn the alliances of our great families before
you speak, or you will sadly blunder."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Madame la Marquise de Senneval is sister of M. le
Duc de Montbrison, into whose establishment you wish
to enter."</p>

<p>"Ah, the devil!"</p>

<p>"Judge of the effect if you had spoken thus of her
before tattling people! You would not have remained
in the house twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"True, Boyer; I must endeavour to 'get up' my
peerage."</p>

<p>"I resume. The father of M. le Vicomte discovered,
after twelve or fifteen years of a marriage very happy
until then, that he had this Polish count to complain of.
Fortunately, or unfortunately, M. le Vicomte was born
nine months after his father, or rather M. le Comte de
Saint-Remy, had returned from this unpropitious journey,
so that he could not be certain, in spite of the greatest
probabilities, whether or not M. le Vicomte could fairly
charge him with paternity. However, the comte separated
instantly from his wife, would not touch a stiver
of the fortune she had brought him, and returned into
the country with about eighty thousand francs which he
possessed of his own. But you have yet to learn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
rancour of this diabolical character. Although the outrage
had been perpetrated fifteen years when he detected
it, the father of M. le Vicomte, accompanied by M. de
Fermont, one of his relatives, sought out this Polonese
seducer, and found him at Venice, after having sought
for him during eighteen months in every city in Europe."</p>

<p>"What determination!"</p>

<p>"A demon's rancour, I say, my dear Edwards! At
Venice there was a ferocious duel, in which the Pole
was killed. All passed off honourably; but they tell
me that, when the father of M. le Vicomte saw the
Pole fall at his feet mortally wounded, he exhibited such
ferocious joy that his relative, M. de Fermont, was
obliged to take him away from the place of combat;
the comte wishing, as he declared, to see his enemy die
before his eyes."</p>

<p>"What a man! What a man!"</p>

<p>"The comte returned to Paris, saw his wife, told her
he had killed the Pole, and went back into the country.
Since that time he never saw her or her son, and resided
at Angers, where he lived, as they say, like a regular old
wolf, with what was left of his eighty thousand francs,
which had been sweated down not a little, as you may
suppose, by his chase after the Pole. At Angers he saw
no one, unless it were the wife and daughter of his
relative, M. de Fermont, who has been dead some years
now. Besides, it was an unfortunate family, for the
brother of Madame de Fermont blew his brains out
some months ago."</p>

<p>"And the mother of M. le Vicomte?"</p>

<p>"He lost her a long time ago; that's the reason that,
when he attained his majority, M. le Vicomte came into
his mother's fortune. So, you see, my dear Edwards,
that, as to inheritance, the vicomte has nothing, or
almost less than nothing, to expect from his father."</p>

<p>"Who, moreover, detests him."</p>

<p>"He never would see him after the discovery in question,
being fully persuaded, no doubt, that he is the son
of the Pole."</p>

<p>The conversation of these two personages was interrupted
by a gigantic footman, elaborately powdered,
although it was scarcely eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>"M. Boyer, M. le Vicomte has rung his bell twice,"
said the giant.</p>

<p>Boyer appeared immensely distressed at having apparently
been inattentive to his duty, rose hastily, and followed
the footman with as much haste and respect as
if he had not been himself, in his proper person, the
proprietor of his master's house.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h5>THE COMTE DE SAINT-REMY.</h5>


<p>It was about two hours after Boyer had left Edwards
to go to M. de Saint-Remy, when the father of the latter
knocked at the door of the house in the Rue de Chaillot.</p>

<p>M. de Saint-Remy, senior, was a tall man, still active
and vigorous in spite of his age. The extreme darkness
of his complexion contrasted singularly with the peculiar
whiteness of his beard and hair; his thick eyebrows
still remained black, and half covered his piercing eyes
deeply sunk in his head. Although from a kind of misanthropic
feeling he wore clothes which were extremely
shabby, yet there was in his entire appearance something
so calm and dignified as to inspire general respect.</p>

<p>The door of his son's house opened, and he went in.</p>

<p>A porter in dress livery of brown and silver, with his
hair carefully powdered, and dressed in silk stockings,
appeared on the threshold of an elegant lodge, which
resembled the smoky cave of the Pipelets as much as
does the tub of a stocking-darner the splendid shop of a
fashionable dressmaker.</p>

<p>"M. de Saint-Remy?" said the comte, in an abrupt
tone.</p>

<p>The porter, instead of replying, scrutinised with impertinent
curiosity the white beard, the threadbare frock coat,
and the napless hat of the unknown, who held a stout
cane in his hand.</p>

<p>"M. de Saint-Remy?" again said the comte, impatiently,
and much irritated at the insolent demeanour of
the porter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"M. le Vicomte is not at home."</p>

<p>So saying, the co-mate of M. Pipelet opened the door,
and, with a significant gesture, invited the unknown to
retire.</p>

<p>"I will wait for him," said the comte, and he moved
forward.</p>

<p>"Holloa! Come, I say, my friend, that's not the way
people enter other people's houses!" exclaimed the
porter, running after the comte, and taking him by
the arm.</p>

<p>"What, fellow!" replied the old man, with a threatening
air, and lifting his cane, "dare you to lay your
hands on me?"</p>

<p>"I dare do more than that if you do not be off
quickly. I tell you the vicomte is not within; so now
go away, will you?"</p>

<p>At this moment Boyer, attracted by the sound of
contending voices, appeared on the steps which led
to the house.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this noise?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"M. Boyer, it is this man, who will go into the house,
although I have told him that M. le Vicomte is not
within."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" said the comte. And then
addressing Boyer, who had come towards them, "I
wish to see my son. He is out, and therefore I will
wait for him."</p>

<p>We have already said that Boyer was neither ignorant
of the existence nor the misanthropy of his master's
father; and being, moreover, a physiognomist, he did
not for a moment doubt the comte's identity, but, bowing
respectfully, replied:</p>

<p>"If M. le Comte will follow me, I will conduct him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well!" said M. de Saint-Remy, who followed
Boyer, to the extreme amazement of the porter.</p>

<p>Preceded by the <i>valet de chambre</i>, the comte reached
the first story, and followed his guide across the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
sitting-room of Florestan de Saint-Remy (we shall in
future call the viscount by his baptismal name to distinguish
him more easily from his father) until they
reached a small antechamber communicating with the
sitting-room, and sitting immediately over the boudoir
on the ground floor.</p>

<p>"M. le Vicomte was obliged to go out this morning,"
said Boyer. "If M. le Comte will be so kind as to wait
a little for him, he will not be long before he comes in."
And the <i>valet de chambre</i> quitted the apartment.</p>

<p>Left alone, the count looked about him with entire
indifference; but suddenly he started, his face became
animated, his cheeks grew purple, and anger agitated
his features. His eyes had lighted on the portrait of
his wife, the mother of Florestan de Saint-Remy! He
folded his arms across his breast, bowed his head, as if
to escape this sight, and strode rapidly up and down the
room.</p>

<p>"This is strange!" he said. "That woman is dead&mdash;I
killed her lover&mdash;and yet my wound is as deep, as
sensitive, as the first day I received it; my thirst of
vengeance is not yet quenched; my savage misanthropy,
which has all but entirely isolated me from the world,
has left me alone, and in constant contemplation of the
thought of my injury. Yes; for the death of the accomplice
of this infamy has avenged the outrage, but not
effaced its memory from my remembrance. Oh, yes! I
feel that what renders my hatred inextinguishable is the
thought that, for fifteen years, I was a dupe; that for
fifteen years I treated with respect and esteem a wretched
woman who had infamously betrayed me; that I have
loved her son&mdash;the son of crime&mdash;as if he had indeed
been my own child; for the aversion with which Florestan
now inspires me proves but too clearly that he is the
offspring of adultery! And yet I have not the absolute
conviction of his illegitimacy: it is just possible that he
is still my child! And sometimes that thought is agony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to me! If he were indeed my son! Then my abandonment
of him, the coldness I have always testified towards
him, my constant refusals to see him, are unpardonable.
But, after all, he is rich, young, happy; and of what use
should I be to him? Yes; but then, perchance, his tenderness
might have soothed the bitter anguish which his
mother has caused me!"</p>

<p>After a moment of deep reflection the comte shrugged
his shoulders and continued:</p>

<p>"Still these foolish suppositions, weak as useless, which
revive all my suffering! Let me be a man, and overcome
the absurd and painful emotion which I experience when
I think that I am again about to see him whom, for ten
years, I have loved with the most mad idolatry,&mdash;whom
I have loved as my son; he&mdash;he&mdash;the son of the man
whose blood I saw flow with such intense joy! And they
would not let me be present at his last agony,&mdash;at his
death! Ah, they know not what it was to have been
stricken as deeply as I was! Then, too, to think that
my name&mdash;always honoured and respected&mdash;should
have been so often mentioned with scoff and derision, as
is always mentioned that of a wronged husband! To
think that my name&mdash;a name of which I had always
been so proud&mdash;should now belong to a man whose
father's heart I could have plucked out! Ah, I only
wonder I do not go mad when I think of it!"</p>

<p>M. de Saint-Remy continued walking up and down in
great agitation, and mechanically lifted up the curtain
which separated the apartment in which he was from
Florestan's private sitting-room, and advanced several
strides into that chamber.</p>

<p>He had disappeared for the moment, when a small
door hidden in the hangings of the wall opened softly,
and Madame de Lucenay, wrapped in a large green cashmere
shawl, having a very plain black velvet bonnet on,
entered the salon, which the comte had but that instant
quitted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>It is necessary to offer some explanation of this unexpected
visit.</p>

<p>Florestan de Saint-Remy on the previous evening made
an appointment with the duchess for the next morning.
She having, as we have said, a key of the little gate in
the narrow lane, had, as usual, entered by the conservatory,
relying on finding Florestan on the ground floor
boudoir; but, not finding him there, she believed (as had
before occurred) that the vicomte was engaged in his
cabinet.</p>

<p>A secret staircase led from the boudoir to the story
above. Madame de Lucenay went up without hesitation,
supposing that M. de Saint-Remy had given orders, as
usual, to be denied to everybody. Unluckily, a threatening
call from M. Badinot had compelled Florestan to go
out hastily, and he had forgotten his rendezvous with
Madame de Lucenay. She, not seeing any person, was
about to enter the cabinet, when the curtain was thrown
on one side, and the duchess found herself confronted
with Florestan's father.</p>

<p>She could not repress a shriek.</p>

<p>"Clotilde!" exclaimed the comte, greatly astonished.</p>

<p>Intimately acquainted with the Prince de Noirmont,
father of Madame de Lucenay, M. de Saint-Remy had
known her from her childhood, and, during her girlhood,
calling her, as he now did, by her baptismal name. The
duchess, motionless with surprise, continued gazing on
the old man with his white beard and mean attire, whose
features she could not recall to mind.</p>

<p>"You, Clotilde!" repeated the comte, in an accent
of painful reproach; "you here, in my son's house!"</p>

<p>These last words confirmed the vague reminiscence
of Madame de Lucenay, who then recognised Florestan's
father, and said:</p>

<p>"M. de Saint-Remy?"</p>

<p>The position was so plain and declaratory that the
duchess, whose peculiar and resolute character is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to the reader, disdained to have recourse to falsehood,
in order to account for her appearance there; and,
relying on the really paternal affection which the comte
had always testified for her, she said to him, with that
air at once graceful, cordial, and decided, which was so
peculiarly her own:</p>

<p>"Come, now, do not scold; you are my old, very old
friend. Recollect you called me your dear little Clotilde
at least twenty years ago."</p>

<p>"Yes, I called you so then; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know beforehand all you would say: you know my
motto, 'What is, is what will be.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clotilde!"</p>

<p>"Spare your reproaches, and let me rather express
my extreme delight at seeing you again: your presence
reminds me of so many things,&mdash;my poor dear father,
in the first place, and then&mdash;heigho! my 'sweet fifteen!'
Oh, how delightful it is to be fifteen!"</p>

<p>"It is because your father was my friend that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the duchess, interrupting M. de Saint-Remy,
"he was so very fond of you! You remember he
always called you the man with the green ribands, and
you always told him, 'You spoil Clotilde; mind, I tell
you so;' and he replied, whilst he kissed me, 'I really
do believe I spoil her, and I must make all haste and
double my spoiling, for very soon the world will deprive
me of her to spoil her in their turn.' Dear father! What
a friend I lost!" and a tear started to the lovely eyes
of Madame de Lucenay; then, extending her hand to
M. de Saint-Remy, she said, in a faltering voice, "But
indeed, in truth, I am happy, very happy, to see you
again, you call up such precious remembrances,&mdash;memories
so dear to my heart!"</p>

<p>The comte, although he had long been acquainted
with her original and decisive disposition, was really
amazed at the ease with which Clotilde reconciled herself
to her exceedingly delicate position, which was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
other than to meet her lover's father in her lover's
house.</p>

<p>"If you have been in Paris for any time," continued
Madame de Lucenay, "it is very naughty of you not to
have come and seen me before this; for we should have
had such long talks over the past; for you must know
that I have reached an age when there is an excessive
pleasure in saying to old friends, 'Don't you
remember!'"</p>

<p>Assuredly the duchess could not have discoursed with
more confirmed tranquillity if she were receiving a
morning visit at the Hôtel de Lucenay. M. de Saint-Remy
could not prevent himself from saying with
severity:</p>

<p>"Instead of talking of the past, it would be more fitting
to discourse of the present. My son is expected
every instant, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Clotilde, interrupting him, "I have the
key of the little door of the conservatory, and his arrival
is always announced by a ring of the bell when he
returns by the principal entrance; and at that sound I
shall disappear as mysteriously as I arrived, and will
leave you to all your pleasure, at again seeing Florestan.
What a delightful surprise you will give him! For it is
so long since you forsook him. Really, now I think of
it, it is I who have to reproach you."</p>

<p>"Me? Reproach me?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly. What guide, what aid had he, when he
entered on the world? whilst there are a thousand
things for which a father's counsels are indispensable.
So, really and truly, it is very wrong of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Madame de Lucenay, yielding to the whimsicality
of her character, could not help laughing most
heartily, and saying to the comte:</p>

<p>"It must be owned that our position is at least an odd
one, and that it is very funny that it should be I who
am sermonising you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, it does seem very strange to me, I assure you;
but I deserve neither your sermons nor your praises. I
have come to my son's house, but not for my son's sake.
At his age, he has not, or has no longer, any need of my
advice."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You ought to know the reason for which I hold
the world, and Paris, especially, in such horror," said
the comte, with a painful and distressing expression;
"and you may therefore believe that nothing but circumstances
of the utmost importance could have induced
me to leave Angers and have come hither&mdash;to this
house. But I have been forced to overcome my repugnance,
and have recourse to everybody who could aid or
help me in a search which is most interesting to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, then," said Madame de Lucenay, with affectionate
eagerness, "I beg you will make use of me;
dispose of me in any way in which I can be useful to
you. Do you want any interest? Because De Lucenay
must have some degree of influence; for, the days when
I go to dine with my great-aunt, De Montbrison, he entertains
the deputies; and men don't do that without some
motives; and the trouble ought to be recompensed by
some contingent advantages, such as a certain amount of
influence over persons, who, in their turn, have a great
deal of interest. So, I repeat, if we can assist you, rely
on us. Then there is my cousin, the young Duke de
Montbrison, who, being a peer himself, is connected with
all the young peers. If he can do anything, why, I am
sure you have but to command him. In a word, dispose
of me and mine. You know whether or not I deserve
the title of a warm and devoted friend!"</p>

<p>"I know it well, and do not refuse your aid, although&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, my dear Alcestis, we know how the world
wags, and let us act as if we did. Whether we are here
or elsewhere, it is of little consequence, I imagine, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the affair which interests you, and which now interests
me very much because it is yours. Let us then talk of
it, and tell me all I request of you."</p>

<p>So saying, the duchess approached the fireplace, leaned
on the mantelpiece, and placed on the fender one of the
prettiest feet in the world, which were, at the moment,
somewhat chilled. With perfect tact Madame de Lucenay
seized the opportunity of saying no more about the
vicomte, and of engaging M. de Saint-Remy to talk of a
subject to which he attached such great importance.
Clotilde's conduct would have been very different in
the presence of his mother, and to her she would have
avowed with pleasure and pride how long he had been
so dear to, so beloved by, her.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>In spite of his strictness and surliness, M. de Saint-Remy
yielded to the influence of the cavalier and cordial
demeanour of this lady, whom he had seen and loved
when a child, and he almost forgot that he was talking
to the mistress of his son. Besides, how could he resist
the contagion of example, while the subject of a position
which was inexpressibly embarrassing did not seem disturbed,
or even think she ought to be disturbed, by
the difficulty of the situation in which she unexpectedly
found herself?</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do not know, Clotilde," said the comte,
"that I have been living at Angers for a very long
time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it."</p>

<p>"In spite of the solitude I sought, I had selected that
city because one of my relations lived there,&mdash;M. de
Fermont,&mdash;who, after the heavy blow that had smitten
me, behaved to me like a brother. After having accompanied
me to almost every city in Europe, where I hoped
to meet with the man I desired to slay, he served me for
second in the duel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that terrible duel; my father told me all concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
it!" answered the duchess, in a sad tone of
voice. "But, fortunately, Florestan is ignorant of that
duel, as well as the cause that led to it."</p>

<p>"I wished to let him still respect his mother," replied
the comte, stifling a sigh. He then continued: "Some
years afterwards, M. de Fermont died at Angers in my
arms, leaving a daughter and a wife, whom, in spite of
my misanthropy, I was obliged to love, because nothing
in the world could be more pure, more noble, than these
two excellent creatures. I lived alone in a remote
quarter of the city; but when my fits of black melancholy
gave me some respite, I went to Madame de
Fermont to talk with her and her daughter of him we
had both lost. As whilst he was alive, so still I came
to soothe and calm myself in that gentle friendship in
whose bosom I had henceforth concentrated all my
affections. The brother of Madame de Fermont dwelt
in Paris, and managed all his sister's affairs after her
husband's decease. He had placed about a hundred
thousand crowns (12,000<i>l.</i>), which was all the widow's
fortune, with a notary.</p>

<p>"After some time another and fearful shock affected
Madame de Fermont. Her brother, M. de Renneville,
killed himself about eight months ago. I did all in my
power to comfort her. Her first sorrow somewhat
abated, she went to Paris to arrange her affairs. After
some time I learned that, by her orders, they were selling
off the furniture she had in her small abode at
Angers, and that the money was applied to the payment
of a few little debts she had left there. This disturbed
me, and, on inquiry, I learned that this unhappy lady
and her daughter were in dire distress,&mdash;the victims,
no doubt, of a bankruptcy. If Madame de Fermont
could, in such straits, rely on any one, it was on me,
and yet I never received any information or application
from her. It was when I lost this acquaintance that
was so delightful to me that I felt all its value. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
cannot imagine my suffering and my uneasiness after
the departure of Madame de Fermont and her daughter.
Their father&mdash;husband&mdash;had been a brother to me,
and I was resolved, therefore, to find them again, to
learn how it was they had not addressed me in their
ruin, poor as I was; and therefore I set out, leaving at
Angers a person who, if anything was learned, would
inform me instantly of the news."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday a letter from Angers reached me,&mdash;they
know nothing. When I reached Paris I began my
researches. I went first to the old servant of Madame
de Fermont's brother; then they told me she lived on
the Quai of the Canal St. Martin."</p>

<p>"Well, that address&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had been theirs; but they had moved, and where
to was not known. Unfortunately, up to the present
time, my researches have been useless. After a thousand
vain attempts before I utterly despaired, I resolved
to come here. Perhaps Madame de Fermont, who, from
some inexplicable motive, has not asked from me aid or
assistance, may have had recourse to my son as to the
son of her husband's best friend. No doubt this hope
has but very slight foundation; but I will not neglect
any chance that may enable me to discover the poor
woman and her child."</p>

<p>The Duchess de Lucenay, who had been listening to
the comte with the utmost attention, said, suddenly:</p>

<p>"Really it would be very singular if these should be
the same persons in whom Madame d'Harville takes so
much interest."</p>

<p>"What persons?" inquired the comte.</p>

<p>"The widow of whom you speak is still young, is she
not?&mdash;her face very striking?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but how do you know?"</p>

<p>"Her daughter, as lovely as an angel, and about sixteen
at most?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"And her name is Claire?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for mercy's sake, say, where are they?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I know not."</p>

<p>"You know not?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you all I know. A lady of my acquaintance,
Madame d'Harville, came to me to inquire whether
or not I knew a widow lady whose daughter was named
Claire, and whose brother had committed suicide. Madame
d'Harville inquired of me because she had seen
these words, 'Write to Madame de Lucenay,' written at
the bottom of a rough sketch of a letter which this
unfortunate lady was writing to some stranger of whom
she was asking assistance."</p>

<p>"She wished to write to you; and wherefore to you?"</p>

<p>"I cannot solve your question."</p>

<p>"But she knew you, it would seem," said M. de Saint-Remy,
struck with a sudden idea.</p>

<p>"What mean you?"</p>

<p>"She had heard me speak of your father a hundred
times, as well as of you and your generous and excellent
heart. In her misfortune, it occurred to her to address
you."</p>

<p>"That really does explain this."</p>

<p>"And Madame d'Harville&mdash;tell me, how did she get
this sketch of a letter into her possession?"</p>

<p>"That I do not know; all I can say is, that, without
knowing whither this poor mother and child had
gone for refuge, she was, I believe, on the trace of
them."</p>

<p>"Then I rely on you, Clotilde, to introduce me to
Madame d'Harville. I must see her this very day."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Her husband has just been the victim
of a most afflicting accident: a pistol which he did not
know to be loaded went off in his hands, and he was
killed on the spot."</p>

<p>"How horrible!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"The marquise went instantly to pass the first months
of her mourning with her father in Normandy."</p>

<p>"Clotilde, I beseech you, write to her to-day; ask her
for all the information in her power, and, as she takes
an interest in these poor women, say she cannot find a
warmer auxiliary than myself; that my only desire is to
find the widow of my friend, and share with her and her
daughter the little I possess. They are now all my
family."</p>

<p>"Ever the same, always generous and devoted! Rely
on me. I will write to-day to Madame d'Harville.
Where shall I address my answer?"</p>

<p>"To Asnières <i>Poste-Restante</i>."</p>

<p>"How odd! Why do you live there, and not in
Paris?"</p>

<p>"I detest Paris, because of the recollections it excites
in me!" said M. de Saint-Remy, with a gloomy air.
"My old physician, Doctor Griffon, with whom I have
kept up a correspondence, has a small house on the
banks of the Seine, near Asnières, which he does not
occupy in the winter; he offered it to me; it is almost
close to Paris, and there I could be undisturbed, and
find the solitude I desire. So I accepted it."</p>

<p>"I will then write to you at Asnières, and I can give
you some information which may be useful to you, and
which I had from Madame d'Harville. Madame de Fermont's
ruin has been occasioned by the roguery of the
notary in whose hands all your deceased relative's fortune
was deposited. The notary denied that the money
was ever placed in his hands."</p>

<p>"The scoundrel! And his name?"</p>

<p>"M. Jacques Ferrand," replied the duchess, without
being able to conceal her inclination to laugh.</p>

<p>"How strange you are, Clotilde!" said the comte,
surprised and annoyed; "nothing can be more serious,
more sad than this, and yet you laugh."</p>

<p>In fact, Madame de Lucenay, at the recollection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
amorous declaration of the notary, had been unable to
repress her hilarity.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my dear sir," she replied, "but this
notary is such a singular being, and they tell such odd
stories about him; but, in truth, if his reputation as an
honest man is not more deserved than his reputation as
a religious man (and I declare that is hypocrisy) he is a
great wretch."</p>

<p>"And he lives&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rue du Sentier."</p>

<p>"I will call upon him. What you tell me confirms
certain other suspicions."</p>

<p>"What suspicions?"</p>

<p>"From certain information as to the death of the brother
of my poor friend, I should be almost tempted to believe
that that unhappy man, instead of committing suicide,
had been the victim of assassination."</p>

<p>"And what can make you suppose that?"</p>

<p>"Several reasons, which would be too long to detail to
you now. I will leave you. Do not forget the promises
of service which you have made me in your own and
your husband's name."</p>

<p>"What, will you go without seeing Florestan?"</p>

<p>"You may suppose how painful this interview would
be to me. I would brave it only in the hope of finding
some information as to Madame de Fermont, being unwilling
to neglect anything to discover her. Now, then,
adieu!"</p>

<p>"Ah, you are pitiless!"</p>

<p>"Do you not know?"</p>

<p>"I know that your son was never in greater need of
your advice."</p>

<p>"What, is he not rich&mdash;happy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he is ignorant of mankind. Blindly extravagant,
because he is generous and confiding in everything,
and everywhere and always free and noble, I fear
people take advantage of his liberality. If you but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
knew the nobleness of his heart! I have never dared
to preach to him on the subject of his expenditure and
want of care: in the first place, because I am as inconsiderate
as himself, and next, in the second place, for
other reasons; whilst you, on the contrary&mdash;"</p>

<p>Madame de Lucenay could not finish. The voice of
Florestan de Saint-Remy was heard. He entered hastily
into the cabinet next to the room in which they were,
and, after having shut the door suddenly, he said, in a
broken voice, to some one who accompanied him:</p>

<p>"But it is impossible."</p>

<p>"I tell you again," replied the clear and sharp voice
of M. Badinot, "I tell you again that, if not, why, in four
hours you will be apprehended; for, if he has not the
cash forthwith, our man will lodge his complaint with
the king's attorney-general; and you know the result of
a forgery like this,&mdash;the galleys, the galleys, my poor
dear vicomte!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h5>THE INTERVIEW.</h5>


<p>It is impossible to paint the look which Madame de
Lucenay and the father of Florestan exchanged at these
terrible words,&mdash;"The galleys, the galleys, my poor dear
vicomte!" The comte became deadly pale, and leant
on the back of an armchair, whilst his knees seemed to
sink beneath him. His venerable and respected name,&mdash;his
name dishonoured by the man whom he accused of
being the fruit of adultery!</p>

<p>The first feeling over, the contracted features of the
old man, a threatening gesture which he made as he
advanced towards the adjoining apartment, betrayed a
resolution so alarming that Madame de Lucenay seized
his hand, and said, in an accent of the most perfect
conviction:</p>

<p>"He is innocent; I will swear it. Listen in silence."</p>

<p>The comte paused. He wished to believe what the
duchess said to him, and she was entirely persuaded of
Florestan's untarnished honour. To obtain fresh sacrifices
from this woman, so blindly generous,&mdash;sacrifices
which alone could save him from arrest,&mdash;and the prosecution
of Jacques Ferrand, the vicomte had affirmed to
Madame de Lucenay that, duped by a scoundrel from
whom he had taken a forged bill in exchange, he ran the
risk of being considered as the forger's accomplice, as
having himself put this bill into circulation. Madame de
Lucenay knew that the vicomte was imprudent, extravagant,
reckless; but she never for an instant supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
him capable, not only of a base or an infamous action,
but even of the slightest indiscretion. Twice lending him
considerable sums under very trying circumstances, she
had wished to render him a friendly service, the vicomte
expressly accepting these loans under the condition that
he should return them; for there were persons, he said,
who owed him double that amount; and his style of
living made it seem probable.</p>

<p>Besides, Madame de Lucenay, yielding to the impulse
of her natural kindness, had only thought of how she
could be useful to Florestan, without ever reflecting as to
whether or not he would ever return the sums thus
advanced. He said so, and she did not doubt him; for,
otherwise, would he have accepted such large amounts?
When, then, she thus answered for Florestan's honour,
entreating the old comte to listen to his son's conversation,
the duchess thought that it was a question of the
breach of honour of which the vicomte had declared
himself the victim, and that he must stand forth completely
exonerated in the eyes of his father.</p>

<p>"Again I declare," continued Florestan, in a troubled
voice, "this Petit-Jean is a scamp; he assured me that
he had no other bills in his hands but those which I received
from him yesterday and three days previously. I
believed this one was still in circulation, and only due
three months hence, in London, at the house of Adams
and Company."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the sarcastic voice of Badinot, "I
know, my dear vicomte, that you had managed the affair
very cleverly, so that your forgeries would not be detected
until you were a long way off; but you tried to
'do' those who were more cunning than yourself."</p>

<p>"And you dare to say that to me, now, rogue as you
are," exclaimed Florestan, furious with anger, "when
was it not you yourself who brought me into contact
with the person who negotiated these bills?"</p>

<p>"Now, my dear aristocrat," replied Badinot, coolly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
"be cool! You very skilfully counterfeit commercial
signatures; but, although they are so adroitly done, that
is no reason why you should treat your friends with disagreeable
familiarity; and, if you give way to unseemly
fits of temper, I shall leave you, and then you may
arrange this matter by yourself."</p>

<p>"And do you think it possible for a man to be calm
in such a position as that in which I find myself? If
what you say be true, if this charge be to-day preferred
at the office of the attorney-general, I am lost!"</p>

<p>"It is really as I tell you, unless you have again recourse
to your charming, blue-eyed Providence."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Then make up your mind to the worst. It is a pity;
it was the last bill; and for five and twenty thousand
miserable francs (1,000<i>l.</i>) to go and take the air at
Toulon is awkward, absurd, foolish! How could a
clever fellow like you allow yourself to be thus taken
aback?"</p>

<p>"What can I do? What can I do? Nothing here
is my own, and I have not twenty louis in the world
left."</p>

<p>"Your friends?"</p>

<p>"Why, I am in debt to every one who could lend me.
Do you think else that I am such a fool as to have waited
until to-day before I applied to them?"</p>

<p>"True; but, come, let us discuss the matter quietly;
that is the best way of arriving at a reasonable conclusion.
Just now, I wish to explain to you how you had
been met by a party more clever than yourself, but you
did not attend to me."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me now, if that will do any good."</p>

<p>"Let us recapitulate. You said to me two months
since, 'I have bills on different banking-houses, at long
dates, for a hundred and thirteen thousand francs
(4,520<i>l.</i>), and, my dear Badinot, I wish you to find
me the means of cashing them.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen: I asked you to let me see these bills; a
certain something made me suspect that they were
forged, although so admirably done. I did not suspect,
it is true, that you were so expert in calligraphy; but,
employing myself in looking after your fortune when
you had no longer any fortune to look after, I found
you were completely done up! I had arranged the deed
by which your horses, your carriages, and the furniture
of this house became the property of Boyer and Edwards.
Thus, then, there was no wonder at my astonishment
when I found you in possession of commercial securities
to such a considerable amount, eh?"</p>

<p>"Never mind your astonishment, but come to the
point."</p>

<p>"I am close upon it. I have enough experience or
timidity not to be very anxious to mix myself up with
affairs of this nature; I therefore advised you to consult
a third party, who, no less clear-sighted than myself,
suspected the trick you desired to play him."</p>

<p>"Impossible! He would not have discounted the
bills if he had believed them forged."</p>

<p>"How much money down did you get for these
hundred and thirteen thousand francs?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five thousand francs in ready money, and
the rest in small debts to collect."</p>

<p>"And how much of these small debts did you
collect?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, as you very well know; they were fictitious;
but still he risked twenty-five thousand francs."</p>

<p>"How green you are, my dear vicomte! Having my
commission of a hundred louis to receive of you if the
affair came off, I took very good care not to say a word
to No. 3 as to the real state of your affairs. Thus he
believed you entirely at your ease, and he, moreover,
knew how you were adored by a certain great lady,
immensely rich, who would not allow you to be left in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
any difficulties, and thus he was quite sure of recovering
at least as much as he advanced. He ran a risk, certainly,
of losing something, but he also ran a chance
of gaining very considerably; and his calculation was
correct, for, the other day, you counted out to him a
hundred thousand francs, good and sound, in order to
retire the bill for fifty-eight thousand francs; and,
yesterday, thirty thousand francs for the second; for
that he contented himself, it is true, with the actual
amount. How you raised these thirty thousand francs
yesterday, devil fetch me, if I can guess! But you are
a wonderful fellow! You see, now, that, to wind up
the account, if Petit-Jean forces you to pay the last bill
of twenty-five thousand francs, he will have received
from you a hundred and fifty-five thousand francs for
the twenty-five thousand which he originally handed to
you. So I was quite right when I said that you had
met with a person even more clever than yourself."</p>

<p>"But why did he say that this last bill which he
presents to-day was negotiated?"</p>

<p>"That you might not take the alarm, he told you also
that, except that of fifty-eight thousand francs, the others
were in circulation; the first being paid, yesterday comes
the second, and to-day the third."</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"Listen: every one for himself; but let us talk
coolly. This must prove to you that Petit-Jean (and,
between ourselves, I should not be astonished to find
out that, in spite of his sanctity, Jacques Ferrand went
snacks in the speculation), this must prove, I say, that
Petit-Jean, led on by your first payments, speculates on
this last bill, as he has speculated on the others, quite
certain that your friends will not allow you to be handed
over to a court of assizes. It is for you to see whether
or not these friendships are yet drained dry, or if there
are yet a few more drops to be squeezed out; for if, in
three hours, the twenty-five thousand francs are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
forthcoming, noble vicomte, you will be in the 'Stone
Jug.'"</p>

<p>"Which you keep saying to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In order that you may thoroughly comprehend me,
and agree, perhaps, to try and draw another feather
from the wing of this generous duchess."</p>

<p>"I repeat, it is useless to think of such a thing. Any
hope of finding twenty-five thousand francs in three
hours, after the sacrifices she has already made, would
be madness to expect."</p>

<p>"To please you, happy mortal, impossibilities would
be attempted!"</p>

<p>"Oh, she has already tried impossibilities; for it was
one to borrow a hundred thousand francs from her husband,
and to succeed; but such phenomena are not expected
twice in a lifetime. Now, my dear Badinot, up
to this time you have had no cause to complain of me.
I have always been generous. Try and obtain some
delay from this wretch, Petit-Jean. You know very
well I always find a way of recompensing those who
serve me; and when once this last affair is got over
I will try again, and you shall be satisfied."</p>

<p>"Petit-Jean is as inflexible as you are unreasonable."</p>

<p>"I!"</p>

<p>"Try once more to interest your generous friend in
your sad fate. Devil take it! Why not tell her plump
all about it; not, as you have already, that you have
been the dupe of forgers, but that you are a forger
yourself?"</p>

<p>"I will never make to her any such confession; it
would be to shame myself for no advantage."</p>

<p>"Do you prefer, then, that she should learn the fact
to-morrow by the <i>Gazette des Tribunaux</i>."</p>

<p>"I have three hours before me, and can fly."</p>

<p>"Where can you go without money? But look at
the other side of the matter. This last forged bill
retired, you will be again in a splendid position; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
will only have a few debts. Come, promise me that
you will again speak to your duchess. You are such
a fellow for the women! You know how to make yourself
interesting in spite of your errors; and, let the
worst come to the worst, they will like you a little the
worse, or not at all; but they will extricate you from
your mess. Come, come, see your lovely and loving
friend once more. I will run to Petit-Jean, and I feel
sure I shall get a respite of an hour or two."</p>

<p>"Hell! Must I, then, drink the draught of shame to
the very dregs?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, good luck; be tender, passionate,
charming. I will run to Petit-Jean; you will find me
there until three o'clock; later than that will be useless;
the attorney-general's office closes at four o'clock."
And M. Badinot left the apartment.</p>

<p>When the door was closed, they heard Florestan
exclaim in accents of the deepest despair: "<i>Mon
Dieu! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!</i>"</p>

<p>During this conversation, which unveiled to the
comte the infamy of his son, and to Madame de
Lucenay the infamy of the man she had so blindly
loved, both had remained motionless, scarcely breathing,
beneath this fearful disclosure. It would be impossible
to depict the mute eloquence of the agonising
scene which took place between this young lady and the
comte when he had no longer any possible doubt as to
Florestan's crime. Extending his arms to the room in
which his son was, the old man smiled with bitterest sarcasm,
casting an overwhelming look on Madame de Lucenay,
which seemed to say, "And this is the man for whom
you have braved all shame,&mdash;made every sacrifice! This
is he whom you have reproached me for abandoning?"</p>

<p>The duchess understood the reproach, and, bowing
her head, she felt all the weight of her shame. The
lesson was terrible. By degrees, however, a haughty
indignation succeeded to the cruel anxiety which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
contracted the features of Madame de Lucenay. The
inexcusable faults of this lady were at least palliated by
the sincerity and disinterestedness of her love, by the
boldness of her devotion and the boundlessness of her
generosity, by the frankness of her character, and by
her inexorable aversion from all that was contemptible
and base.</p>

<p>Still too young, too handsome, too <i>recherché</i>, to feel
the humiliation of having been merely made a tool of,
when once the feeling of love was suddenly crushed
within her, this haughty and decided woman felt no
longer hatred or anger, but instantaneously, and without
any transition, a deadly disgust, an icy disdain, at once
destroyed all that affection hitherto so strong. She was
no longer the mistress, unworthily deceived by her lover,
but the lady of high blood and rank detecting a man of
her circle to be a swindler and a forger, and driving him
forth. Supposing that there were even some extenuating
circumstances for the ignominy of Florestan, Madame de
Lucenay would not have admitted them; for, in her estimation,
the man who crossed certain bounds of honour,
whether from vice, weakness, or persuasion, no longer
had an existence in her eyes, honourable demeanour
being with her a question of existence or non-existence.
The only painful feeling which the duchess experienced
was excited by the terrible effect which this unexpected
revelation produced on her old friend, the comte.</p>

<p>For some moments he seemed neither to see nor hear;
his eyes were fixed, his head bowed, his arms hanging
by his side, his face livid as death; whilst from time to
time a convulsive sigh heaved his breast. With such a
man, as resolute as energetic, such a condition was more
alarming than the most violent transports of anger. Madame
de Lucenay regarded him with great uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Courage, my dear friend," she said to him, in a low
voice, "for you,&mdash;for me,&mdash;for this man,&mdash;I know
what remains for me to do."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man looked steadfastly at her, and then, as
if aroused from his stupor by a violent internal commotion,
he raised his head, his features assumed a menacing
appearance, and, forgetting that his son could hear
him, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"And I, too, for you,&mdash;for me,&mdash;and for this man,&mdash;I
know what remains for me to do."</p>

<p>"Who is there?" inquired Florestan, surprised.</p>

<p>Madame de Lucenay, fearing to find herself in the
vicomte's presence, disappeared by the little door, and
descended the secret staircase. Florestan having again
asked who was there, and receiving no reply, entered
the salon. He found the comte there alone. The old
man's long beard had so greatly altered him, and he
was so miserably clad, that his son, who had not seen
him for several years, not recognising him at the
moment, advanced towards him with a menacing air.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"The husband of that woman!" replied the comte,
pointing to the picture of Madame de Saint-Remy.</p>

<p>"My father!" exclaimed Florestan, recoiling in
alarm, as he recalled the features of the comte, so
long forgotten.</p>

<p>Standing erect, with threatening air, angry look, his
forehead scarlet, the comte looked down upon his son,
who, with his head bent down, dared not raise his eyes
towards him. Still, M. de Saint-Remy, for some motive,
made a violent effort to remain calm, and conceal his
real feelings and resentment.</p>

<p>"My father!" said Florestan, half choked. "You
were there?"</p>

<p>"I was there."</p>

<p>"You heard, then?"</p>

<p>"All!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the vicomte, in agony, and hiding his
face in his hands.</p>

<p>There was a minute's silence. Florestan, at first as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
much astonished as annoyed at the unexpected appearance
of his father, began to reflect upon what advantage
he could derive from this incident.</p>

<p>"All is not lost," he said to himself; "my father's
presence is a stroke of fate. He knows all; he will not
have his name dishonoured. He is not rich, but he
must possess more than twenty-five thousand francs.
A little skill, and I may leave my duchess at peace,
and be saved!" Then, giving to his handsome features
an expression of grief and dejection, moistening his eye
with the tears of repentance, assuming his most touching
tone of voice, he exclaimed, clasping his hands with a
gesture of despair:</p>

<p>"Ah, father, I am indeed wretched! After so many
years,&mdash;to see you&mdash;at such a moment! I must appear
to you most culpable; but deign to listen to me! I
beseech you, allow me, not to justify myself, but to
explain to you my conduct! Will you, my father?"</p>

<p>M. de Saint-Remy made no reply; his features
remained rigid; but, seating himself, his chin leaning
on the palm of his hand, he contemplated the vicomte in
silence. Had Florestan known the motives which filled
the mind of his father with fury and vengeance, alarmed
by the apparent composure of the comte, he would not,
doubtless, have tried to dupe him. But, ignorant of the
suspicions respecting the legitimacy of his birth, and of
his mother's lapse of virtue, he had no doubt of the success
of his deceit, thinking his father, who was very
proud of his name, was capable of making any sacrifice
rather than allow it to be dishonoured.</p>

<p>"My father," resumed Florestan, timidly, "allow me
to endeavour, not to exculpate myself, but to tell you by
what a series of involuntary temptations I have done, in
spite of myself,&mdash;such&mdash;an infamous action."</p>

<p>The vicomte took his father's silence for tacit consent,
and continued:</p>

<p>"When I had the misfortune to lose my mother&mdash;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
poor mother!&mdash;I was alone, without advice or support.
Master of a considerable fortune, used to luxury from
my cradle, it became to me a necessity. Ignorant how
difficult it is to earn money, I was immeasurably prodigal.
Unfortunately, my expenses, foolish as they were,
were remarkable for their elegance. By my taste, I
eclipsed men ten times richer than myself. This first
success intoxicated me, and I became a man of extravagance,
as one becomes a man of arms, or a statesman.
Yes, I liked luxury, not from vulgar ostentation, but I
liked it as a painter loves his art. Like every artist,
I was jealous of my work, and my work was to me luxury.
I sacrificed everything to its perfection. I wished
to have it beautiful and complete in everything, from my
stable to my drawing-room, from my coat to my house.
I wished my life to be the emblem of taste and elegance.
In fact, as an artist, I sought the applause of the mob
and the admiration of the élite. This success is rare,
but I acquired it."</p>

<p>As he spake, Florestan's features gradually lost their
hypocritical assumption, and his eyes kindled with enthusiasm.
He looked in his father's face, and, thinking it
was somewhat softened, continued:</p>

<p>"Oracle and regulator of the world, my praise or
blame were law: I was quoted, copied, boasted of,
admired, and that by the best circle in Paris, which
is to say in Europe&mdash;in the world. The women participated
in the general enthusiasm, and the loveliest contended
for the pleasure of being invited to certain fêtes
which I gave, and everywhere wonder was expressed at
the incomparable elegance and taste displayed at these
fêtes, which millionaires could not equal. In fine, I was
the monarch of fashion. This word will tell you all, my
father, if you comprehend it."</p>

<p>"I do comprehend it, and I am sure that at the
galleys you will invent some refined elegance in your
fashion of wearing your chain that will become the mode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in your gang, and will be called <i>à la</i> Saint-Remy," said
the old man, with cutting irony, adding, "and Saint-Remy,&mdash;that
is my name!" And again he was silent.</p>

<p>Florestan had need of all his self-control to conceal
the wound which this bitter sarcasm inflicted. He
continued in a more humble tone:</p>

<p>"Alas! Father, it is not from pride that I revive the
recollection of my success, for, I repeat to you, it is that
success which has undone me. Sought, envied, and flattered,
not by interested parasites, but by persons much
superior in position to myself, I no longer calculated my
fortune must be expended in a few years; that I did not
heed. Could I renounce this favourite, dazzling life, in
which pleasures succeeded pleasures, every kind of intoxication
to every kind of enchantment? Ah, if you knew,
father, what it is to be hailed as the hero of the day,
to hear the murmur which greets your entrance into the
salon, to hear the women say, 'That is he! There he
is!'&mdash;oh, if you knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said the old man, without moving from his
attitude,&mdash;"I know. Yes, the other day, in a public
place, there was a crowd; suddenly a murmur was
heard, like that which greets you when you enter some
place; then the women's eyes were all turned eagerly
on a very handsome young man, just as they are turned
towards you, and they pointed him out to one another,
saying, 'That's he! There he is!' just as if they were
directing attention to you."</p>

<p>"And this man, my father?"</p>

<p>"Was a forger they were conveying to gaol."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Florestan, with concentrated rage.
Then affecting the deepest affliction, he added, "My
father, you are pitiless,&mdash;what shall I then say to you?
I do not seek to deny my errors, I only desire to explain
to you the fatal infatuation which has caused them.
Well, then, even if you should overwhelm me still with
your bitterest sarcasms, I will endeavour to go through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
with this confession,&mdash;I will endeavour to make you
comprehend this feverish excitement which has destroyed
me, because then, perchance, you may pity me,&mdash;yes, for
there is pity for a madman, and I was mad! Shutting
my eyes, I abandoned myself to the dazzling whirl into
which I was drawn, and drew with me the most charming
women, the most delightful men. How could I check
myself? As easily say to the poet who exhausts himself,
and whose genius preys upon his health, 'Pause in
the midst of the inspiration which urges you!' No!
He could not&mdash;I could not, abdicate the royalty which
I exercised, and return shamed, ruined, and mocked at,
into the unknown mob, giving this triumph to those who
envied me, and whom, until then, I had defied, controlled,
overpowered! No! No! I could not, voluntarily, at
least.</p>

<p>"Then came the fatal day, when, for the first time,
money failed me. I was surprised as much as if such a
moment never could have arrived. Yet I had still my
horses, my carriages, the furniture of this house. When
my debts were paid there would, perhaps, still remain to
me about sixty thousand francs. What could I do in
such misery? It was then, father, that I made my first
step in the path of disgrace; until this time I was honourable,&mdash;I
had only spent what belonged to me, but
then I began to incur debts which I had no chance of
paying. I sold all I had to two of my domestics in order
to pay my debt to them, and to be enabled to continue
for six months longer, in spite of my creditors, to enjoy
the luxury which intoxicated me.</p>

<p>"To supply my play debts and extravagant outlay I first
borrowed of the Jews, then, to pay the Jews, of my
friends, then, to pay my friends, of my mistresses.
These resources exhausted, there was another period of
my life; from an honest man I became a gambler, but,
as yet, I was not criminal&mdash;I still hesitated&mdash;I desired
to take a violent resolution. I had proved in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
duels that I did not fear death. I determined to kill
myself!"</p>

<p>"Ah! Bah! Really?" said the comte, with fierce
irony.</p>

<p>"You do not believe me, father?"</p>

<p>"It was too soon or too late!" replied the old man,
still unmoved, and in the same attitude.</p>

<p>Florestan, believing that he had moved his father by
speaking to him of his project for committing suicide,
thought it necessary to increase the effect by a <i>coup de
théâtre</i>. He opened a drawer, took from it a small
bottle of greenish glass, and said to the comte, depositing
it on the table:</p>

<p>"An Italian quack sold me this poison."</p>

<p>"And was this poison for yourself?" said the old
man, still having his chin in the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>Florestan understood the force of the remark, his
features expressed real indignation; for this time he
spoke the truth. One day he took it into his head to kill
himself,&mdash;an ephemeral fancy! Persons of his stamp
are usually too cowardly to make up their minds calmly,
and without witnesses, to the death which they face as a
point of honour in a duel. He therefore exclaimed, with
an accent of truth:</p>

<p>"I have fallen very low, but not so low as that. It
was for myself that I reserved this poison."</p>

<p>"And then were afraid of it?" asked the comte, without
changing his posture.</p>

<p>"I confess I recoiled before this trying extremity,&mdash;nothing
was yet desperate. The persons to whom I owed
money were rich and could wait. At my age, and with
my connections, I hoped for a moment, if not to repair
my fortunes, at least to acquire for myself an honourable
position, an independence which would have supplied my
present situation. Many of my friends, perhaps less
qualified than myself, had made rapid progress in diplomacy.
I had ambition. I had but to make it known,
and I was attached to the legation to Gerolstein. Unfortunately,
a few days after this nomination, a gaming
debt, contracted with a man who detested me, placed me
in a cruel dilemma. I had exhausted my last resources.
A fatal idea flashed across my mind. Believing that I
was assured of impunity, I committed an infamous action.
You see, my father, I conceal nothing from you. I avow
the ignominy of my conduct,&mdash;I do not seek to extenuate
anything. Two alternatives are now before me, and I am
equally inclined to either. The one is to kill myself, and
leave your name dishonoured; for if I do not pay this
very day the twenty-five thousand francs, the accusation
is made, and all is made public, and, dead or alive, I am
disgraced. The second is to throw myself into your arms,
father, to say to you, 'Save your son,&mdash;save your name
from infamy;' and I swear to you to depart for Africa
to-morrow, and die a soldier's death, or return to you
completely restored in reputation. What I say to you,
father, is true,&mdash;in face of the extremity which overwhelms
me, I have no other resource. Decide: shall I
die covered with shame, or, thanks to you, live to repair
my fault? These are not the threats of a young man.
I am twenty-five; I bear your name, and I have sufficient
courage either to kill myself, or to become a soldier; for
I will not go to the galleys."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>The comte rose from his seat, saying:</p>

<p>"I do not desire to have my name dishonoured."</p>

<p>"Oh, my father!" exclaimed the vicomte, with
warmth, and was about to embrace his father, when
the old man, repressing his enthusiasm, said:</p>

<p>"You are expected until three o'clock at the man's
house who has the forged bill?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father, and it is now two o'clock."</p>

<p>"Let us go into your cabinet; give me writing materials."</p>

<p>"They are here, father."</p>

<p>The comte sat down and wrote, with a firm hand:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"I undertake to pay this evening, at ten o'clock, the twenty-five
thousand francs which my son owes.</p>

<p class="sigs">"<span class="smcap">Comte de Saint-Remy</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>"Your creditor merely wants his money; my guarantee
will obtain a further delay. Let him go to M.
Dupont, the banker, at No. 7 in the Rue Richelieu, and
he will assure him of the validity of this promise."</p>

<p>"Oh, my father! How can I ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Expect me this evening; at ten o'clock I will bring
the money. Let your creditor be here."</p>

<p>"Yes, father, and the day after I will set out for
Africa. You shall see that I am not ungrateful! Then,
perhaps, when I am again restored to honour you will
accept my thanks?"</p>

<p>"You owe me nothing. I have said that my name
shall not be dishonoured again; nor shall it be," said
M. de Saint-Remy, in reply, taking up his cane, and
moving towards the door.</p>

<p>"My father, at least shake hands with me!" said
Florestan.</p>

<p>"Here this evening at ten o'clock," said the comte,
refusing his hand.</p>

<p>"Saved!" exclaimed Florestan, joyously,&mdash;"saved!"
Then he continued, after a moment's reflection: "Saved&mdash;almost&mdash;no
matter&mdash;it is always so. Perhaps this
evening I shall tell him of the other thing. He is in the
vein, and will not allow a first sacrifice to become useless
for lack of a second. Yet why should I tell him?
Who will ever know it? Yet, if nothing should be discovered,
I shall keep the money he will give me to pay
this last debt. I had some work to move him. The
bitterness of his sarcasms made me suspicious of his good
resolution; but my threat of suicide, the fear of seeing
his name dishonoured, decided him. That was the way
to hit him. No doubt he is not so poor as he appears to
be. But his arrival was indeed a godsend. Now, then,
for the man of law!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>He rang the bell, and M. Boyer appeared.</p>

<p>"How was it that you did not inform me that my
father was here? Really, this is most negligent."</p>

<p>"Twice I endeavoured to address your lordship when
you came in by the garden gate with M. Badinot, but
your lordship made me a sign with your hand not to
interrupt you. I did not venture to insist. I should be
very much grieved if your lordship should impute negligence
to me."</p>

<p>"Very well. Desire Edwards to harness Orion or
Ploughboy in the cabriolet immediately."</p>

<p>M. Boyer made a respectful bow. As he was about
to quit the room, some one knocked. He looked at the
vicomte with an inquiring air.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said Florestan.</p>

<p>A second <i>valet de chambre</i> appeared, bearing in his
hand a small silver-gilt waiter. M. Boyer took hold
of the waiter with a kind of jealous haste, and presented
it to the vicomte, who took from it a thick packet,
sealed with black wax.</p>

<p>The two servants withdrew discreetly.</p>

<p>Florestan broke open the envelope. It contained
twenty-five thousand francs in treasury bills, but not a
word of writing.</p>

<p>"Decidedly," he exclaimed, in a joyful tone, "the day
is propitious! Saved this time, and at this moment
completely saved! I will run to the jeweller; and yet,"
he added, "perhaps&mdash;no&mdash;let us wait&mdash;he cannot
have any suspicion of me. Twenty-five thousand francs
is a pleasant sum to have by one! <i>Pardieu!</i> I was a
fool ever to doubt the luck of my star; at the moment
when it seemed most obscure, has it not burst forth
more brilliant than ever? But where does this money
come from? The writing of the address is unknown to
me. Let me examine the seal,&mdash;the cipher. Yes, yes,
I cannot mistake; an N and an L,&mdash;it is Clotilde!
How could she know? And not a word,&mdash;that's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
strange! How very opportune, though! Ah, <i>mon
Dieu!</i> now I remember. I had an appointment with
her this morning. That Badinot's threats drove it out
of my head. I forgot Clotilde. After having waited for
me down-stairs, no doubt she went away; and this is,
unquestionably, a delicate way of making me understand
that she fears I may forget her through some pecuniary
embarrassment. Yes, it is an indirect reproach that I
have not applied to her as usual. Good Clotilde! Always
the same,&mdash;generous as a queen! What a pity I
was ever driven to ask her,&mdash;her still so handsome!
I sometimes regret it, but I only did it in a direful
extremity, and on sheer compulsion."</p>

<p>"Your lordship's cabriolet is at the door," said M.
Boyer, on entering the room.</p>

<p>"Who brought this letter?" Florestan inquired.</p>

<p>"I do not know, my lord."</p>

<p>"Well, I will ask below. But tell me, was there no
one in the ground floor?" asked the vicomte, looking
significantly at Boyer.</p>

<p>"There is no one there now, my lord."</p>

<p>"I was not mistaken," thought Florestan; "Clotilde
waited for me, and is now gone."</p>

<p>"If your lordship would have the goodness to grant
me two minutes," said Boyer.</p>

<p>"Speak, but be quick!"</p>

<p>"Edwards and myself have learnt that the Duc de
Montbrison is desirous of forming an establishment. If
your lordship would but just be so kind to propose your
own ready furnished, with the stable in first-rate order,
it would be a most admirable opportunity for Edwards
and myself to get the whole off our hands, and, perhaps,
for your lordship a good reason for disposing of them."</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu!</i> Boyer, you are right. As for me, I should
prefer such an arrangement. I will see Montbrison, and
speak to him. What are your terms?"</p>

<p>"Your lordship will easily understand that we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
desirous of profiting as much as possible by your generosity."</p>

<p>"And turn your bargain to the best advantage? Nothing
can be plainer! Let us see,&mdash;what's the price?"</p>

<p>"The whole, two hundred and sixty thousand francs
(10,400<i>l.</i>), my lord."</p>

<p>"And you and Edwards will thus clear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About forty thousand francs (1,600<i>l.</i>), my lord."</p>

<p>"A very nice sum! But so much the better, for,
after all, I am very much satisfied with you, and, if I
had to make my will, I should have bequeathed that
sum to you and Edwards."</p>

<p>And the vicomte went out, first to call on his creditor,
then on Madame de Lucenay, whom he did not suspect
of having been present at his conversation with Badinot.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h5>THE SEARCH.</h5>


<p>The Hôtel de Lucenay was one of those royal residences
of the Faubourg St. Germain, which the space
employed, and, as it were, lost, make so vast. A
modern house might, with ease, be contained in the
limits devoted to the staircase of one of these palaces,
and a whole quarter might be built in the extent they
occupy.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock in the evening of this day the two
vast folding-doors of this hôtel opened on the arrival of
a magnificent chariot, which, after having taken a dashing
turn in the spacious courtyard, stopped before the
large covered flight of steps which led to the first antechamber.
Whilst the hoofs of two powerful and high-couraged
horses sounded on the echoing pavement, a
gigantic footman opened the door, emblazoned with
armorial bearings, and a young man alighted gracefully
from this brilliant carriage, and no less gracefully
walked up the five or six steps of the entrance. This
young man was the Vicomte de Saint-Remy.</p>

<p>On leaving his creditor, who, satisfied with the undertaking
of Florestan's father, had granted the required
delay, and was to come and receive his money at ten
o'clock in the Rue de Chaillot, M. de Saint-Remy had
gone to Madame de Lucenay's, to thank her for the
fresh service she had rendered him, and, not having
seen the duchess during the morning, he came triumphant,
certain of finding her in <i>prima sera</i>, the hour
which she constantly reserved for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>By the attention of the footmen in the antechamber,
who hastened to open the glass door as soon as they
saw Florestan's carriage, by the profoundly respectful
air with which the rest of the livery all rose as the
vicomte passed by, and by certain, yet almost imperceptible
touches, it was evident that here was the second,
or, rather, the real master of the house.</p>

<p>When the Duc de Lucenay returned home, with his
umbrella in his hand and his feet protected by clumsy
goloshes (he hated going out in a carriage in the daytime),
the same domestic evolutions were gone through
with similar respect; still, in the eyes of a keen observer,
there was a vast difference between the reception
accorded to the husband and that reserved for the lover.</p>

<p>A corresponding attention displayed itself in the footman's
waiting-room when Florestan entered it, and one
of the valets instantly arose to announce him to Madame
de Lucenay.</p>

<p>The vicomte had never been more joyous, never felt
himself more at his ease, more confident of himself,
more assured of conquest. The victory he had obtained
over his father in the morning, the fresh proof of attachment
on the part of Madame de Lucenay, the joy at
having escaped, as it were, by a miracle, from a terrible
situation, his renewed confidence in his star, gave his
handsome features an expression of boldness and good
humour which rendered it still more captivating.</p>

<p>In fact, he had never felt himself more himself. And
he was right. Never had his slender and graceful figure
displayed a finer carriage, never had his look been more
elevated, never had his pride been more deliciously
tickled by the thought, "The great lady&mdash;the mistress
of this palace is mine&mdash;is at my feet! This very
morning she waited for me in my own house!"</p>

<p>Florestan had given way to these excessively vain-glorious
reflections as he traversed three or four apartments,
which led to a small room in which the duchess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
usually sat. A last look at himself in a glass which he
passed completed the excellent opinion which Florestan
had of himself. The <i>valet de chambre</i> opened the folding-doors
of the salon, and announced, "Monsieur the
Vicomte de Saint-Remy!"</p>

<p>It is impossible to paint the astonishment and indignation
of the duchess. She believed the comte had not
concealed from his son that she also had overheard all.</p>

<p>We have already said that, on discovering Florestan's
infamy, Madame de Lucenay's love, suddenly quenched,
had changed into the most frigid disdain. We have also
said that, in the midst of her errors, her frailties, Madame
de Lucenay had preserved pure and intact her
feelings of rectitude, honour, and chivalric frankness,
whose strength and requirements were excessively strong.
She possessed the better qualities of her faults, the
virtues of her vices.</p>

<p>Treating love as cavalierly as a man treats it, she
pushed as far, nay, further, than a man, devotion, generosity,
courage, and, above all, intense horror of all
baseness. Madame de Lucenay, being about to go to
a party in the evening, was, although without her
diamonds, dressed with her accustomed taste and magnificence;
and her splendid costume, the rouge she wore
without attempt at concealment, like a court lady, up to
her eyelids, her beauty, which was especially brilliant at
candle-light, her figure of a goddess walking in the
clouds, rendered still more striking that noble air which
no one displayed to greater advantage than she did, and
which she carried, if requisite, to a height of insolence
that was overwhelming.</p>

<p>We know the haughty and resolute disposition of the
duchess, and we may imagine her physiognomy, her
look, when the vicomte, advancing towards her, conceited,
smiling, confident, said, in a tone of love:</p>

<p>"Dearest Clotilde, how good you are! How you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The vicomte could not finish. The duchess was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
seated, and had not risen; but her gesture, her glance,
betokened contempt, at once so calm and crushing that
Florestan stopped short. He could not utter another
word, nor advance another step. He had never before
seen Madame de Lucenay under this aspect. He could
not believe that it was the same woman, whom he had
always found gentle, tender, and passionately submissive;
for nothing is more humble, more timid, than a
determined woman in the presence of the man whom
she loves and who controls her.</p>

<p>His first surprise past, Florestan was ashamed of his
weakness; his habitual audacity resumed its ascendency,
and, making a step towards Madame de Lucenay in order
to take her hand, he said, in his most insinuating tone:</p>

<p>"Clotilde, what ails you? I never saw you look so
lovely, and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really, this is too impudent!" exclaimed the
duchess, recoiling with such disgust and hauteur that
Florestan was again overcome with surprise.</p>

<p>Resuming some assurance, he said to her:</p>

<p>"Will you, at least, Clotilde, tell me the cause of this
change, sudden, singular as it is? What have I done?
How have I offended?"</p>

<p>Without making any reply, Madame de Lucenay
looked at him, as is vulgarly said, from head to foot,
with so insulting an expression that Florestan felt red
with the anger which displayed itself upon his brow, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I am aware, madame, that it is thus you habitually
break off. Is it a rupture that you now desire?"</p>

<p>"The question is singular!" said Madame de Lucenay,
with a sarcastic laugh. "Learn, sir, that when a lackey
robs me, I do not break with him, I turn him away."</p>

<p>"Madame!"</p>

<p>"Oh, a truce to this!" said the duchess, in a stern
and peremptory tone. "Your presence disgusts me!
Why are you here? Have you not had your money?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is true, then, as I guessed, the twenty-five thousand
francs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your last forgery is withdrawn, is it not? The
honour of your family's name is saved,&mdash;that is well,&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>"Ah! believe me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I very much regret that money, for it might have
succoured so many honest families; but it was necessary
to think of the shame to your father and to
myself."</p>

<p>"So then, Clotilde, you know all? Ah, then, now
nothing is left me but to die!" exclaimed Florestan,
in a most pathetic and despairing tone.</p>

<p>A burst of derisive laughter from the duchess hailed
this tragic exclamation, and she added, between two fits
of fresh hilarity:</p>

<p>"I could never have believed infamy could appear so
ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Madame!" cried Florestan, his features contracted
with rage.</p>

<p>The two folding-doors opened with a loud noise, and
M. le Duc de Montbrison was announced.</p>

<p>In spite of his self-command, Florestan could scarcely
repress the violence of his resentment, which any man
more observing than the duke must certainly have
perceived.</p>

<p>M. de Montbrison was scarcely eighteen years of age.
Let our readers imagine a most engaging countenance,
like that of a young girl, white and red, whose vermilion
lips and downy chin were slightly shaded by a nascent
beard. Let them add to this large brown eyes, as yet
timid, but which in time would gleam like a falcon's, a
figure as graceful as that of the duchess herself, and
then, perhaps, they may have some idea of this young
duke, the Cherubino as complete in idea as ever countess
or waiting-maid decked in a woman's cap, after having
remarked the ivory whiteness of his neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>The vicomte had the weakness or the audacity to
remain.</p>

<p>"How kind of you, Conrad, to think of me this
evening!" said Madame de Lucenay, in a most affectionate
voice, and extending her hand to the young
duke, who was about to shake hands with his cousin,
but Clotilde raised her hand a little, and said to him
gaily:</p>

<p>"Kiss it, cousin,&mdash;you have your gloves on."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my dear cousin," said the young man,
as he applied his lips to the naked and charming hand
that was offered to him.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do this evening, Conrad?"
inquired Madame de Lucenay, without seeming to take
the slightest notice in the world of Florestan.</p>

<p>"Nothing, cousin; when I leave you, I shall go to the
club."</p>

<p>"Indeed you shall not; you shall accompany us, M. de
Lucenay and me, to Madame de Senneval's; she gives a
party, and has frequently asked me to introduce you to
her."</p>

<p>"I shall be but too happy."</p>

<p>"Then, too, I must tell you frankly that I don't like
to see you begin so early with your habits and tastes for
clubs. You are possessed of everything necessary in
order to be everywhere welcomed, and even sought after,
in the world, and you ought, therefore, to mix with it as
much as possible."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right, cousin."</p>

<p>"And as I am on the footing of a grandmother with
you, my dear Conrad, I am determined to exact a great
deal from you. You are emancipated, it is true, but I
believe you will want a guardian for a long time to come,
and you must, therefore, consider me in that light."</p>

<p>"Most joyfully, happily, cousin!" said the young duke,
emphatically.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the mute rage of Florestan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
who was standing up, and leaning with his elbow on the
mantelpiece. Neither the duke nor Clotilde paid the
slightest attention to him. Knowing the rapidity with
which Madame de Lucenay decided, he imagined she was
pushing her boldness and contempt so far as to commence
at once, and in his presence, a regular flirtation
with the Duc de Montbrison.</p>

<p>It was not so. The duchess felt for her cousin
nothing beyond a truly maternal affection, having
almost seen him born. But the young duke was so
handsome, and seemed so happy at the agreeable
reception of his cousin, that the jealousy, or, rather,
pride of Florestan was aroused. His heart writhed
beneath the cruel wounds of envy, excited by Conrad
de Montbrison, who, rich and handsome, was beginning
so splendidly that life of pleasures, enjoyments, and
fêtes, from which he, ruined, undone, despised, dishonoured,
was expelled.</p>

<p>M. de Saint-Remy was brave with that bravery of the
head, if we may so call it, which will urge a man, by
anger or by vanity, to face a duel. But, vitiated and
corrupted, he had not the courage of the heart which
triumphs over bad inclinations, or which, at least, gives
the energy which enables a man to escape infamy by a
voluntary death. Furious at the bitter contempt of the
duchess, believing he saw a successor in the young duke,
M. de Saint-Remy resolved to confront Madame de
Lucenay with all insolence, and, if need were, to seek a
quarrel with Conrad.</p>

<p>The duchess, irritated at Florestan's audacity, did not
look towards him, and M. de Montbrison, in his anxious
attention to his cousin, forgetting something of his high
breeding, had not saluted or spoken a word to the
vicomte, with whom he was acquainted. The latter,
advancing to Conrad, whose back was towards him,
touched his arm lightly, and said, in a dry and ironical
tone:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good evening, sir; a thousand pardons for not
having observed you before."</p>

<p>M. de Montbrison, perceiving that he had really failed
in politeness, turned around instantly, and said cordially
to the vicomte:</p>

<p>"Really, sir, I am ashamed; but I hope that my
cousin, who caused my forgetfulness, will be my excuse,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Conrad," interposed the duchess, immeasurably
annoyed at Florestan's impudence, persisting as he
did in remaining, as it were, to brave her,&mdash;"Conrad,
that will do; make no apologies; it is not worth while."</p>

<p>M. de Montbrison, believing that his cousin was
reproaching him in joke for being somewhat too
formal, said, in a gay tone, to the vicomte, who was
livid with rage:</p>

<p>"I will not say more, sir, since my cousin forbids me.
You see her guardianship has begun."</p>

<p>"And will not stop when it begins, my dear sir, be
assured of that. Thus, with this notice (which Madame
la Duchesse will hasten to fulfil, I have no doubt)&mdash;with
this notice, I say, I have it in my mind to make you a
proposal."</p>

<p>"To me, sir?" said Conrad, beginning to take offence
at the sardonic tone of Florestan.</p>

<p>"To you yourself. I leave in a few days for the
legation to Gerolstein, to which I am attached. I wish,
therefore, to get my house, completely furnished, and my
stable, entirely arranged, off my hands; and you might
find it a suitable arrangement;" and the vicomte insolently
emphasised his last words, looking Madame de
Lucenay full in the face. "It would be very piquant,
would it not, Madame la Duchesse?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, sir," said M. de Montbrison,
more and more astonished.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, Conrad, why you cannot accept the
offer that is made you," said Clotilde.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why, Madame la Duchesse, cannot the duke
accept my offer?"</p>

<p>"My dear Conrad, what is offered you for sale is
already sold to others. So, you understand, you would
have the inconvenience of being robbed just as if you
were in a wood."</p>

<p>Florestan bit his lips with rage.</p>

<p>"Take care, madame!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What, threats! and here, sir?" exclaimed Conrad.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! Conrad, pay no attention," said
Madame de Lucenay, taking a lozenge from a sweetmeat
box with the utmost composure; "a man of
honour ought not and cannot have any future communication
with that person. If he likes, I will tell
you why."</p>

<p>A tremendous explosion would no doubt have
occurred, when the two folding-doors again opened,
and the Duc de Lucenay entered, noisily, violently,
hurriedly, as was "his usual custom in the afternoon,"
as well as the forenoon.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear! What, dressed already?" said he to
his wife. "Why, how surprising! Quite astonishing!
Good evening, Saint-Remy; good evening, Conrad.
Ah, you see the most miserable of men; that is to
say, I neither sleep nor eat, but am completely 'done
up.' Can't reconcile myself to it. Poor D'Harville,
what an event!" And M. de Lucenay threw himself
back in a sort of small sofa with two backs, and, crossing
his left knee over his right, took his foot in his
hand, whilst he continued to utter the most distressing
exclamations.</p>

<p>The excitement of Conrad and Florestan had
time to calm down, without being perceived by M. de
Lucenay, who was the least clear-sighted man in the
world.</p>

<p>Madame de Lucenay, not from embarrassment, for
she was never embarrassed, as we know, but because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Florestan's presence was as disgusting as it was insupportable,
said to the duke:</p>

<p>"We are ready to go as soon as you please. I am
going to introduce Conrad to Madame de Senneval."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" cried the duke, letting go his foot to
seize one of the cushions, on which he struck violently
with his two fists, to the great alarm of Clotilde, who,
at the sudden cries of her husband, started from her
chair.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, what ails you?" she inquired; "you
frighten me exceedingly."</p>

<p>"No," replied the duke, thrusting the cushion from
him, rising suddenly, and walking up and down with
rapid strides and gesticulations, "I cannot get over the
idea of the death of poor dear D'Harville; can you,
Saint-Remy?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, it was a frightful event!" said the vicomte,
who, with hatred and rage in his heart, kept his eye on
M. de Montbrison; but this latter, after the last words
of his cousin, turned away from a man so deeply
degraded, not from want of feeling, but from pride.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, my lord," said the duchess to
her husband, "do not regret the loss of M. d'Harville in
so noisy and really so singular a manner. Ring, if you
please for my carriage."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is really true," said M. de Lucenay, seizing
the bell-rope, "really true that, three days ago, he was
full of life and health, and, to-day, what remains of
him? Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!"</p>

<p>These three last exclamations were accompanied by
three such violent pulls that the bell-rope, which the
duke held in his hand whilst he was gesticulating, broke
away from the upper spring, fell on a candelabra filled
with lighted wax candles, knocked two of them out of
the sconces, one of which, falling on the mantelpiece,
broke a lovely little cup of old Sèvres china; whilst the
other, falling on the ground, rolled on a fur hearth rug,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
which took flame, but was soon extinguished under
Conrad's foot.</p>

<p>At the same moment, two <i>valets de chambre</i>, summoned
by the furious ringing, entered hastily, and found
M. de Lucenay with the bell-rope in his hand, the
duchess laughing heartily at this ridiculous fall of the
wax lights, and M. de Montbrison sharing her mirth.
M. de Saint-Remy alone did not laugh. M. de Lucenay,
quite accustomed to such accidents, preserved his usual
seriousness, and, throwing the bell-rope to one of the
men, said:</p>

<p>"The duchess's carriage."</p>

<p>Clotilde, having somewhat recovered her composure,
said:</p>

<p>"Really, my lord, there is no man in the world but
yourself capable of exciting laughter at so lamentable an
event."</p>

<p>"Lamentable! Say fearful. Why, now, only yesterday,
I was recollecting how many persons in my own
family I would rather should have died than poor
D'Harville. First, there's my nephew, D'Emberval,
who stutters so annoyingly; then there's your Aunt
Mérinville, who is always talking about her nerves
and her headache, and who always gobbles up every
day, whilst she is waiting for dinner, a mess of broth
like a porter's wife. Are you very fond of your Aunt
Mérinville?"</p>

<p>"Really, my lord, have you lost your wits?" said the
duchess, shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's true enough, though," continued the duke;
"one would give twenty indifferent persons for one
friend; eh, Saint-Remy?"</p>

<p>"Unquestionably."</p>

<p>"It is the old story of the tailor over again. Do you
know it, Conrad,&mdash;the story of the tailor?"</p>

<p>"No, cousin."</p>

<p>"You will understand the allegory at once. A tailor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
was going to be hanged; he was the only tailor in the
village. What were the inhabitants to do? They said
to the judge, 'Please your judgeship, we have only one
tailor, and we have three shoemakers; if it is all the
same to you, please to hang one of the three shoemakers
in the place of the tailor, for two shoemakers are
enough.' Do you understand the allegory, Conrad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, cousin."</p>

<p>"And you, Saint-Remy?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"Her grace's carriage!" said one of the servants.</p>

<p>"But, I say, why haven't you put on your diamonds?"
asked M. de Lucenay, abruptly; "with that dress they
would look remarkably well."</p>

<p>Saint-Remy shuddered.</p>

<p>"For the one poor time we are going out together,"
continued the duke, "you might have done us the honour
to wear your diamonds. The duchess's diamonds
are particularly fine. Did you ever see them, Saint-Remy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he knows them well enough!" said Clotilde;
and then she added, "Your arm, Conrad."</p>

<p>M. de Lucenay followed the duchess with Saint-Remy,
who could scarcely repress his anger.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming with us to the Sennevals, Saint-Remy?"
inquired M. de Lucenay.</p>

<p>"No, impossible," he replied, briefly.</p>

<p>"By the way, Saint-Remy, there's Madame de Senneval,
too,&mdash;what, do I say one? There's two&mdash;whom I
would willingly sacrifice, for her husband is also on
my list."</p>

<p>"What list?"</p>

<p>"That of the people whom I should not have cared to
see die, provided D'Harville had been left to us."</p>

<p>At the moment when they were in the anteroom, and
M. de Montbrison was helping the duchess on with her
mantle, M. de Lucenay, addressing his cousin, said to him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Since you are coming with us, Conrad, desire your
carriage to follow ours; unless you will decide on coming,
Saint-Remy, and then you shall take me, and I will
tell you another story quite as good as that of the
tailor."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Saint-Remy, dryly, "I cannot
accompany you."</p>

<p>"Well, then, good night, my dear fellow. Have you
and my wife quarrelled, for she is getting into her
carriage without saying a word to you?"</p>

<p>And at this moment, the duchess's berline having
drawn up at the steps, she entered it.</p>

<p>"Now, cousin," said Conrad, waiting for M. de
Lucenay with an air of deference.</p>

<p>"Get in! Get in!" said the duke, who had stopped
a moment, and, from the door, was contemplating the
elegant equipage of the vicomte. "Are those your
grays, Saint-Remy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And your jolly-looking Edwards! He's what I call
a right sort of coachman. How well he has his horses
in hand! To do justice, there is no one who, like Saint-Remy,
does things in such devilish high style!"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, Madame de Lucenay and your
cousin are waiting for you," said M. de Saint-Remy,
with bitterness.</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu!</i> and that's true. What a forgetful rascal
I am! <i>Au revoir</i>, Saint-Remy. Ah, I forgot," said
the duke, stopping half way down the steps, "if you
have nothing better to do, come and dine with us to-morrow.
Lord Dudley has sent us some grouse from
Scotland, and they are out-of-the-way things, you know.
You'll come, won't you?" And the duke sprang into
the carriage which contained his wife and Conrad.</p>

<p>Saint-Remy remained alone on the steps, and saw the
carriage drive away. His own then drove up. He got
into it, casting on that house which he had so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
entered as master, and which now he so ignominiously
quitted, a look of anger, hatred, and despair.</p>

<p>"Home!" he said, abruptly.</p>

<p>"To the hôtel!" said the footman to Edwards, as he
closed the door.</p>

<p>We may imagine how bitter and desolating were
Saint-Remy's thoughts as he returned to his house. At
the moment when he reached it, Boyer, who awaited
him at the portico, said to him:</p>

<p>"M. le Comte is above, and waits for M. le Vicomte."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"And there is also a man whom your lordship
appointed at ten o'clock,&mdash;a M. Petit-Jean."</p>

<p>"Very well. Oh, what an evening party!" said
Florestan, as he went up-stairs to see his father, whom
he found in the salon on the first floor, the same room
in which their meeting of the morning had taken place.
"A thousand pardons, my father, that I was not awaiting
you when you arrived; but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is the man here who holds the forged bill?" inquired
the comte, interrupting his son.</p>

<p>"Yes, father, he is below."</p>

<p>"Desire him to come up."</p>

<p>Florestan rang, and Boyer appeared.</p>

<p>"Desire M. Petit-Jean to come up."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," and Boyer withdrew.</p>

<p>"How good you are, father, to remember your kind
promise!"</p>

<p>"I always remember what I promise."</p>

<p>"What gratitude do I owe you! How can I ever
prove to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will not have my name dishonoured! It shall not
be!"</p>

<p>"It shall not be! No, it shall never be, I swear to
you, my father!"</p>

<p>The comte looked strangely at his son, and repeated:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it shall never be!" Then he added, with a
sarcastic air, "You are a prophet."</p>

<p>"I read my resolution in my heart."</p>

<p>Florestan's father made no rejoinder. He walked up
and down the room with his two hands thrust into the
pockets of his long coat. He was very pale.</p>

<p>"M. Petit-Jean," said Boyer, introducing a man of a
mean, sordid, and crafty look.</p>

<p>"Where is the bill?" inquired the comte.</p>

<p>"Here it is, sir," said Petit-Jean (Jacques Ferrand
the notary's man of straw), handing the bill to the
comte.</p>

<p>"Is this it?" said the latter, showing the bill to his
son.</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>The comte took from his waistcoat pocket twenty-five
notes of a thousand francs each, handed them to his son,
and said:</p>

<p>"Pay!"</p>

<p>Florestan paid, and took the bill with a deep sigh of
the utmost satisfaction. M. Petit-Jean put the notes
carefully in an old pocket-book, made his bow, and
retired. M. de Saint-Remy left the salon with him,
whilst Florestan was very carefully tearing up the bill.</p>

<p>"At least Clotilde's twenty-five thousand francs are
still in my pocket, and if nothing is revealed, that is a
comfort. But how she treated me! But what can my
father have to say to the man Petit-Jean?"</p>

<p>The noise of a door being double-locked made the
vicomte start. His father returned to the room. His
pallor had even increased.</p>

<p>"I fancied, father, I heard you lock the door of my
cabinet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"And why, my dear father?" asked Florestan, greatly
amazed.</p>

<p>"I will tell you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>And the comte placed himself so that his son could
not pass out by the secret staircase which led to the
ground floor.</p>

<p>Florestan, greatly disquieted, now observed the sinister
look of his father, and followed all his movements with
mistrust. Without being able to account for it, he felt
a vague alarm.</p>

<p>"What ails you, father?"</p>

<p>"This morning when you saw me, your only thought
was, 'My father will not allow his name to be dishonoured;
he will pay if I can but contrive to wheedle
him by some feigned words of repentance.'"</p>

<p>"Can you indeed think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not interrupt me. I have not been your dupe;
you have neither shame, regret, nor remorse. You are
vicious to the very core, you have never felt one
honest aspiration, you have not robbed as long as
you have been in possession of wherewithal to gratify
your caprices,&mdash;that is what is called the probity of rich
persons of your stamp. Then came the want of delicate
feeling, then meannesses, then crime, then forgery. This
is but the first period of your life,&mdash;it is bright and
pure in comparison with that which would be yet to
come."</p>

<p>"If I did not change my conduct, assuredly; but I
shall change it, father, I have sworn to you."</p>

<p>"You will not change it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will not change it! Expelled from society in
which you have hitherto lived, you would become very
quickly criminal, like the wretches amongst whom you
would be cast, a thief inevitably, and, if your need were,
an assassin. That would be your future life."</p>

<p>"I an assassin?&mdash;I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because you are a coward!"</p>

<p>"I have had duels, and have evinced&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you, you are a coward! You have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
preferred infamy to death. A day would come in which
you would prefer the impunity for fresh crimes to the
life of another. This must not be,&mdash;I will not allow it.
I have come in time, at least, to save my name from
public dishonour hereafter. There must be an end to
this."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, dearest father? How an end
to this? What would you imply?" exclaimed Florestan,
still more alarmed at the fearful expression and the
increased pallor of his father's countenance.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a violent blow struck on the
cabinet door. Florestan made a motion to go and open
it, in order to put an end to a scene which terrified him;
but the comte seized him with a hand of iron, and held
him fast.</p>

<p>"Who knocks?" inquired the comte.</p>

<p>"In the name of the law, open! Open!" said a
voice.</p>

<p>"That forgery, then, was not the last," exclaimed the
comte, in a low voice, and looking at his son with a
terrible air.</p>

<p>"Yes, my father, I swear it!" exclaimed Florestan,
endeavouring, but vainly, to extricate himself from the
vigorous grasp of his father.</p>

<p>"In the name of the law, open!" repeated the voice.</p>

<p>"What is it you seek?" demanded the comte.</p>

<p>"I am a commissary of police, and I have come to
make a search after a robbery of diamonds, of which
M. de Saint-Remy is accused. M. Baudoin, a jeweller,
has proofs. If you do not open, sir, I shall be compelled
to force open the door."</p>

<p>"Already a thief! I was not then deceived," said
the comte, in a low voice. "I came to kill you,&mdash;I
have delayed too long."</p>

<p>"Kill me?"</p>

<p>"There is already too much dishonour on my name,&mdash;it
must end. I have here two pistols; you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
blow out your brains, or I will blow them out, and I
will say that you killed yourself in despair in order
to escape from shame."</p>

<p>And, with a fearful <i>sang-froid</i>, the comte drew a
pistol from his pocket, and, with the hand that was
free, presented it to his son, saying:</p>

<p>"Now an end to this, if, indeed, you are not a
coward!"</p>

<p>After repeated and ineffectual attempts to free himself
from the comte's hand, his son fell back aghast and
livid with fear. He saw by the fearful look, the inexorable
demeanour of his father, that he had no pity to
expect from him.</p>

<p>"My father!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You must die!"</p>

<p>"I repent!"</p>

<p>"It is too late. Hark! They are forcing in the
door!"</p>

<p>"I will expiate my faults!"</p>

<p>"They are entering! Must I then kill you with my
own hand?"</p>

<p>"Pardon!"</p>

<p>"The door gives way! You will then have it so!"</p>

<p>And the comte placed the muzzle of the weapon
against Florestan's breast.</p>

<p>The noise without announced that the door of the
cabinet could not long resist. The vicomte saw he
was lost. A sudden and desperate resolution lighted
up his countenance. He no longer struggled with his
father, and he said to him, with equal firmness and
resignation:</p>

<p>"You are right, my father! Give me the pistol!
There is infamy enough on my name! The life in store
for me is frightful, and is not worth the trouble of a
struggle. Give me the pistol! You shall see if I am
a coward!" and he put forth his hand to take the
pistol. "But, at least, one word,&mdash;one single word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of consolation,&mdash;pity,&mdash;farewell!" said Florestan; and
his trembling lips, his paleness, his agitated features, all
betokened the terrible emotion of this frightful moment.</p>

<p>"But what if he were, indeed, my son!" thought the
comte, with terror, and hesitating to hand him the deadly
instrument. "If he were my son I ought to hesitate
before such a sacrifice."</p>

<p>A loud cracking of the cabinet door announced that
it was being forced.</p>

<p>"My father, they are coming! Oh, now I feel that
death is indeed a benefit. Yes, now I thank you! But,
at least, your hand,&mdash;and forgive me!"</p>

<p>In spite of his sternness, the comte could not repress
a shudder, as he said, in a voice of emotion:</p>

<p>"I forgive you."</p>

<p>"My father, the door opens; go to them, that, at
least, they may not even suspect you. Besides, if they
enter here, they will prevent me from completing,&mdash;adieu!"</p>

<p>The steps of several persons were heard in the next
room. Florestan placed the muzzle of the pistol to his
heart. It went off at the instant when the comte, to
avoid the horrid sight, turned away his head, and
rushed out of the salon, whose curtains closed upon
him.</p>

<p>At the sound of this explosion, at the sight of the
comte, pale and haggard, the commissary stopped short
at the threshold of the door, making a sign to his agents
to pause also.</p>

<p>Informed by Boyer that the vicomte was shut up with
his father, the magistrate understood all, and respected
his deep grief.</p>

<p>"Dead!" exclaimed the comte, hiding his face in
his hands. "Dead!" he repeated in a tone of agony.
"It was just,&mdash;better death than infamy! But it is
horrible!"</p>

<p>"Sir," said the magistrate, sorrowfully, after a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
minutes' silence, "spare yourself a painful spectacle,&mdash;leave
the house. And now I have another duty to
fulfil, even more painful than that which summoned
me hither."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, sir," said M. de Saint-Remy;
"as to the sufferer by this robbery, you will request
him to call on M. Dupont, the banker."</p>

<p>"In the Rue Richelieu? He is very well known,"
replied the magistrate.</p>

<p>"What is the estimated value of the stolen diamonds?"</p>

<p>"About thirty thousand francs. The person who
bought them, and by whom the fraud was detected,
gave that amount for them to your son."</p>

<p>"I can still pay it, sir. Let the jeweller go to my
banker the day after to-morrow, and I will have it all
arranged."</p>

<p>The commissary bowed. The comte left the room.</p>

<p>After the departure of the latter, the magistrate,
deeply affected by this unlooked-for scene, went slowly
towards the salon, the curtains of which were closed.
He moved them on one side with agitation.</p>

<p>"Nobody!" he exclaimed, amazed beyond measure,
and looking around him, unable to see the least trace
of the tragic event which he believed had just occurred.</p>

<p>Then, seeing a small door in the panel of the apartment,
he went towards it. It was fastened in the side
of the secret staircase.</p>

<p>"It was a trick, and he has escaped by this door!" he
exclaimed, with vexation.</p>

<p>And in fact, the vicomte, having in his father's presence
placed the pistol on his heart, had very dexterously
fired it under his arm, and rapidly made off.</p>

<p>In spite of the most careful search throughout the
house, they could not discover Florestan.</p>

<p>During the conversation with his father and the commissary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
he had quickly gained the boudoir, then the
conservatory, then the lone alley, and so to the Champs
Elysées.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The picture of this ignoble degradation in opulence is
a sad thing.</p>

<p>We are aware of it. But for want of warnings, the
richer classes have also fatally their miseries, vices,
crimes. Nothing is more frequent and more afflicting
than those insensate, barren prodigalities which we have
now described, and which always entail ruin, loss of
consideration, baseness, or infamy. It is a deplorable,
sad spectacle, just like contemplating a flourishing field
of wheat destroyed by a herd of wild beasts. No doubt
that inheritance, property, are, and ought to be, inviolable,
sacred. Wealth acquired or transmitted ought to
be able to shine with impunity and magnificently in the
eyes of the poor and suffering masses. We must, too,
see those frightful disproportions which exist between
the millionaire Saint-Remy, and the artisan Morel. But,
inasmuch as these inevitable disproportions are consecrated,
protected by the law, so those who possess such
wealth ought morally to be accountable to those who
have only probity, resignation, courage, and desire to
labour.</p>

<p>In the eyes of reason, human right, and even of a
well-understood social interest, a great fortune should
be a hereditary deposit, confided to prudent, firm, skilful,
generous hands, which, entrusted at the same time
to fructify and expend this fortune, know how to fertilise,
vivify, and ameliorate all that should have the felicity to
find themselves within the scope of its splendid and
salutary rays.</p>

<p>And sometimes it is so, but the instances are very
rare. How many young men, like Saint-Remy, masters
at twenty of a large patrimony, spend it foolishly in
idleness, in waste, in vice, for want of knowing how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
employ their wealth more advantageously either for
themselves or for the public. Others, alarmed at the
instability of human affairs, save in the meanest manner.
Thus there are those who, knowing that a fixed
fortune always diminishes, give themselves up, fools or
rogues, to that hazardous, immoral gaming, which the
powers that be encourage and patronise.</p>

<p>How can it be otherwise? Who imparts to inexperienced
youth that knowledge, that instruction, those
rudiments of individual and social economy? No one.</p>

<p>The rich man is thrown into the heart of society with
his riches, as the poor man with his poverty. No one
takes any more care of the superfluities of the one than
of the wants of the other. No one thinks any more of
making the one moralise than the other. Ought not
power to fulfil this great and noble task?</p>

<p>If, taking to its pity the miseries, the continually
increasing troubles, of the still resigned workmen, repressing
a rivalry injurious to all, and, addressing itself
finally to the imminent question of the organisation of
labour, it gave itself the salutary lesson of the association
of capital and labour; and if there were an honourable,
intelligent, equitable association, which should
assure the well-doing of the artisan, without injuring
the fortune of the rich, and which, establishing between
the two classes the bonds of affection and gratitude,
would for ever keep safeguard over the tranquillity of
the state,&mdash;how powerful, then, would be the consequences
of such a practical instruction!</p>

<p>Amongst the rich, who then would hesitate as to
the dishonourable, disastrous chances of stock-jobbing,
the gross pleasures of avarice, the foolish vanities of
a ruinous dissipation; or, a means at once remunerative
and beneficial, which would shed ease, morality,
happiness, and joy, over scores of families?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h5>THE ADIEUX.</h5>


<p>The day after that on which the Comte de Saint-Remy
had been so shamefully tricked by his son, a
touching scene took place at St. Lazare at the hour of
recreation amongst the prisoners.</p>

<p>On this day, during the walk of the other prisoners,
Fleur-de-Marie was seated on a bench close to the fountain
of the courtyard, which was already named "La
Goualeuse's Bench." By a kind of taciturn agreement,
the prisoners had entirely given up this seat to her, as
she had evinced a marked preference for it,&mdash;for the
young girl's influence had decidedly increased. La
Goualeuse had selected this bench, situated close to
the basin, because the small quantity of moss which
velveted the margin of the reservoir reminded her of
the verdure of the fields, as the clear water with which
it was filled reminded her of the small river of Bouqueval.
To the saddened gaze of a prisoner a tuft of grass
is a meadow, a flower is a garden.</p>

<p>Relying on the kind promises of Madame d'Harville,
Fleur-de-Marie had for two days expected her release
from St. Lazare. Although she had no reason for
being anxious about the delay in her discharge, the
young girl, from her experience in misfortune, scarcely
ventured to hope for a speedy liberation. Since her
return amongst creatures whose appearance revived at
each moment in her mind the incurable memory of her
early disgrace, Fleur-de-Marie's sadness had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
more and more overwhelming. This was not all. A
new subject of trouble, distress, and almost alarm to her,
had arisen from the impassioned excitement of her
gratitude towards Rodolph.</p>

<p>It was strange, but she only fathomed the depth of
the abyss into which she had been plunged, in order to
measure the distance which separated her from him
whose perfection appeared to her more than human,
from this man whose goodness was so extreme, and his
power so terrible to the wicked. In spite of the respect
with which her adoration for him was imbued, sometimes,
alas! Fleur-de-Marie feared to detect in this
adoration the symptoms of love, but of a love as secret
as it was deep, as chaste as it was secret, and as hopeless
as it was chaste. The unhappy girl had not thought of
reading this withering revelation in her heart until after
her interview with Madame d'Harville, who was herself
smitten with a love for Rodolph, of which he himself was
ignorant.</p>

<p>After the departure and the promises of the marquise,
Fleur-de-Marie should have been transported with joy
on thinking of her friends at Bouqueval, of Rodolph
whom she was again about to see. But she was not.
Her heart was painfully distressed, and to her memory
occurred incessantly the severe language, the haughty
scrutiny, the angry looks, of Madame d'Harville, as the
poor prisoner had been excited to enthusiasm when
alluding to her benefactor. By singular intuition La
Goualeuse had thus detected a portion of Madame
d'Harville's secret.</p>

<p>"The excess of my gratitude to M. Rodolph offended
this young lady, so handsome and of such high rank,"
thought Fleur-de-Marie; "now I comprehend the severity
of her words, they expressed a jealous disdain.
She jealous of me! Then she must love him, and I must
love, too&mdash;him? Yes, and my love must have betrayed
itself in spite of me! Love him,&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;a creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
fallen for ever, ungrateful and wretched as I am! Oh,
if it were so, death were a hundred times preferable!"</p>

<p>Let us hasten to say that the unhappy girl, thus a
martyr to her feelings, greatly exaggerated what she
called her love.</p>

<p>To her profound gratitude towards Rodolph was united
involuntary admiration of the gracefulness, strength, and
manly beauty which distinguished him from other men.
Nothing could be less gross, more pure, than this admiration;
but it existed in full and active force, because
physical beauty is always attractive. And then the
voice of blood, so often denied, mute, unknown, or misinterpreted,
is sometimes in full force, and these throbs
of passionate tenderness which attracted Fleur-de-Marie
towards Rodolph, and which so greatly startled her,
because in her ignorance she misinterpreted their tendency,
these feelings resulted from mysterious sympathies,
as palpable, but as inexplicable, as the resemblance of
features. In a word, Fleur-de-Marie, on learning that
she was Rodolph's daughter, could have accounted to
herself for the strong affection she had for him, and
thus, completely enlightened on the point, she would
have admired without a scruple her father's manly
beauty.</p>

<p>Thus do we explain Fleur-de-Marie's dejection. Although
she was every instant awaiting, according to
Madame d'Harville's promise, her release from St.
Lazare, Fleur-de-Marie, melancholy and pensive, was
seated on her bench near the basin, looking with a kind
of mechanical interest at the sports of some bold little
birds who came to play on the margin of the stone-work.
She had ceased for an instant to work at a baby's nightgown,
which she had just finished hemming. Need we
say that this nightgown belonged to the lying-in clothes
so generously offered to Mont Saint-Jean by the prisoners,
through the kind intervention of Fleur-de-Marie?
The poor misshapen protégée of La Goualeuse was sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
at her feet, working at a small cap, and, from time to
time, casting at her benefactress a look at once grateful,
timid, and confiding, such a look as a dog throws at his
master. The beauty, attraction, and delicious sweetness
of Fleur-de-Marie had inspired this fallen creature with
sentiments of the most profound respect.</p>

<p>There is always something holy and great in the aspirations
of a heart, which, although degraded, yet feels for
the first time sensations of gratitude; and, up to this time,
no one had ever given Mont Saint-Jean the opportunity
of even testifying whether or not she could comprehend
the religious ardour of a sentiment so wholly unknown
to her. After some moments Fleur-de-Marie shuddered
slightly, wiped a tear from her eyes, and resumed her
sewing with much activity.</p>

<p>"You will not then leave off your work even during the
time for rest, my good angel?" said Mont Saint-Jean to
La Goualeuse.</p>

<p>"I have not given you any money towards buying
your lying-in clothes, and I must therefore furnish my
part with my own work," replied the young girl.</p>

<p>"Your part! Why, but for you, instead of this good
white linen, this nice warm wrapper for my child, I
should have nothing but the rags they dragged in the
mud of the yard. I am very grateful to my companions
who have been so very kind to me; that's quite true!
But you!&mdash;ah, you!&mdash;how can I tell you all I feel?"
added the poor creature, hesitating, and greatly embarrassed
how to express her thought. "There," she said,
"there is the sun, is it not? That is the sun?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mont Saint-Jean; I am attending to you," replied
Fleur-de-Marie, stooping her lovely face towards
the hideous countenance of her companion.</p>

<p>"Ah, you'll laugh at me," she replied, sorrowfully.
"I want to say something, and I do not know how."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, say it, Mont Saint-Jean!"</p>

<p>"How kind you look always," said the prisoner, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
at Fleur-de-Marie in a sort of ecstasy; "your eyes
encourage me,&mdash;those kind eyes! Well, then, I will try
and say what I wish: There is the sun, is it not? It is so
warm, it lights up the prison, it is very pleasant to see
and feel, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"But I have an idea,&mdash;the sun didn't make itself, and
if we are grateful to it, why, there is greater reason still
why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why we should be grateful to him who created it;
that is what you mean, Mont Saint-Jean? You are
right; and we ought to pray to, adore him,&mdash;he is
God!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is my idea!" exclaimed the prisoner, joyously.
"That is it! I ought to be grateful to my companions,
but I ought to pray to, adore you, Goualeuse,
for it is you who made them so good to me, instead of
being so unkind as they had been."</p>

<p>"It is God you should thank, Mont Saint-Jean, and
not me."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes, it is you, I see you; and it is you who
did me such kindness, by yourself and others."</p>

<p>"But if I am as good as you say, Mont Saint-Jean, it
is God who has made me so, and it is he, therefore,
whom we ought to thank."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed, it may be so since you say it!" replied
the prisoner, whose mind was by no means decided;
"and if you desire it, let it be so; as you please."</p>

<p>"Yes, my poor Mont Saint-Jean, pray to him constantly,
that is the best way of proving to me that you
love me a little."</p>

<p>"If I love you, Goualeuse? Don't you remember,
then, what you said to those other prisoners to prevent
them from beating me?&mdash;'It is not only her whom you
beat, it is her child also!' Well, it is all the same as the
way I love you; it is not only for myself that I love
you, but also for my child."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks, Mont Saint-Jean, you please me
exceedingly when you say that." And Fleur-de-Marie,
much moved, extended her hand to her companion.</p>

<p>"What a pretty, little, fairy-like hand! How white and
small!" said Mont Saint-Jean, receding as though she
were afraid to touch it with her coarse and clumsy hands.</p>

<p>Yet, after a moment's hesitation, she respectfully applied
her lips to the end of the slender fingers which
Fleur-de-Marie extended to her, then, kneeling suddenly,
she fixed on her an attentive, concentrated look.</p>

<p>"Come and sit here by me," said La Goualeuse.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed; never, never!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Respect discipline, as my brave Mont Saint-Jean
used to say; soldiers together, officers together, each
with his equals."</p>

<p>"You are crazy; there is no difference between us
two."</p>

<p>"No difference! And you say that when I see you, as
I do now, as handsome as a queen. Oh, what do you
mean now? Leave me alone, on my knees, that I may
look at you as I do now. Who knows, although I am
a real monster, my child may perhaps resemble you?
They say that sometimes happens from a look."</p>

<p>Then by a scruple of incredible delicacy in a creature
of her position, fearing, perhaps, that she had humiliated
or wounded Fleur-de-Marie by her strange desire, Mont
Saint-Jean added, sorrowfully:</p>

<p>"No, no, I was only joking, Goualeuse; I never could
allow myself to look at you with such an idea,&mdash;unless
with your free consent. If my child is as ugly as I am,
what shall I care? I sha'n't love it any the less, poor
little, unhappy thing; it never asked to be born, as they
say. And if it lives what will become of it?" she
added, with a mournful and reflective air. "Alas, yes,
what will become of us?"</p>

<p>La Goualeuse shuddered at these words. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
what was to become of the child of this miserable, degraded,
abased, poor, despised creature?</p>

<p>"What a fate! What a future!"</p>

<p>"Do not think of that, Mont Saint-Jean," said Fleur-de-Marie;
"let us hope that your child will find benevolent
friends in its way."</p>

<p>"That chance never occurs twice, Goualeuse," replied
Mont Saint-Jean, bitterly, and shaking her head. "I have
met with you, that is a great chance; and then&mdash;no
offence&mdash;I should much rather my child had had that
good luck than myself, and that wish is all I can do for
it!"</p>

<p>"Pray, pray, and God will hear you."</p>

<p>"Well, I will pray, if that is any pleasure to you,
Goualeuse, for it may perhaps bring me good luck. Indeed,
who could have thought, when La Louve beat me,
and I was the butt of all the world, that I should meet
with my little guardian angel, who with her pretty soft
voice would be even stronger than all the rest, and that
La Louve who is so strong and so wicked&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but La Louve became very good to you as soon
as she reflected that you were doubly to be pitied."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is very true, thanks to you; I shall never
forget it. But, tell me, Goualeuse, why did she the
other day request to have her quarters changed,&mdash;La
Louve, she, who, in spite of her passionate temper,
seemed unable to do without you?"</p>

<p>"She is rather wilful."</p>

<p>"How odd! A woman, who came this morning from
the quarter of the prison where La Louve now is, says
that she is wholly changed."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Instead of quarrelling and contending with everybody,
she is sad, quite sad, and sits by herself, and if
they speak to her she turns her back and makes no
answer. It is really wonderful to see her quite still,
who used always to be making such a riot; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the woman says another thing, which I really cannot
believe."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, that she had seen La Louve crying; La Louve
crying,&mdash;that's impossible!"</p>

<p>"Poor Louve! It was on my account she changed
her quarters; I vexed her without intending it," said La
Goualeuse, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"You vex any one, my good angel?"</p>

<p>At this moment, the inspectress, Madame Armand,
entered the yard. After having looked for Fleur-de-Marie,
she came towards her with a smiling and satisfied
air.</p>

<p>"Good news, my child."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, madame?" said La Goualeuse,
rising.</p>

<p>"Your friends have not forgotten you, they have obtained
your discharge; the governor has just received
the information."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible, madame? Ah, what happiness!"</p>

<p>Fleur-de-Marie's emotion was so violent that she
turned pale, placed her hand on her heart, which throbbed
violently, and fell back on the seat.</p>

<p>"Don't agitate yourself, my poor girl," said Madame
Armand, kindly. "Fortunately these shocks are not
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Ah, madame, what gratitude!"</p>

<p>"No doubt it is Madame d'Harville who has obtained
your liberty. There is an elderly female charged to conduct
you to the persons who are interested in you. Wait
for me, I will return for you; I have some directions to
give in the work-room."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to paint the expression of extreme
desolation which overcast the features of Mont Saint-Jean,
when she learned that her good angel, as she called
La Goualeuse, was about to quit St. Lazare. This
woman's grief was less caused by the fear of becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
again the ill-used butt of the prison, than by her anguish
at seeing herself separated from the only being who had
ever testified any interest in her.</p>

<p>Still seated at the foot of the bench, Mont Saint-Jean
lifted both her hands to the sides of her matted and
coarse hair, which projected in disorder from the sides of
her old black cap, as if to tear them out; then this deep
affliction gave way to dejection, and she drooped her head
and remained mute and motionless, with her face hidden
in her hands, and her elbows resting on her knees.</p>

<p>In spite of her joy at leaving the prison, Fleur-de-Marie
could not help shuddering when she thought for
an instant of the Chouette and the Schoolmaster, recollecting
that these two monsters had made her swear
never to inform her benefactors of her wretched fate.
But these dispiriting thoughts were soon effaced from
Fleur-de-Marie's mind before the hope of seeing Bouqueval
once more, with Madame Georges and Rodolph, to
whom she meant to intercede for La Louve and Martial.
It even seemed to her that the warm feeling which she
reproached herself for having of her benefactor, being no
longer nourished by sadness and solitude, would be
calmed down as soon as she resumed her rustic occupations,
which she so much delighted in sharing with the
good and simple inhabitants of the farm.</p>

<p>Astonished at the silence of her companion, a silence
whose source she did not suspect, La Goualeuse touched
her gently on the shoulder, saying to her:</p>

<p>"Mont Saint-Jean, as I am now free, can I be in any
way useful to you?"</p>

<p>The prisoner trembled as she felt La Goualeuse's
hand upon her, let her hands drop on her knees, and
turned towards the young girl, her face streaming with
tears. So bitter a grief overspread the features of
Mont Saint-Jean that their ugliness had disappeared.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said La Goualeuse. "You
are weeping!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are going away!" murmured the poor prisoner,
with a voice broken by sobs. "And I had never thought
that you would go away, and that I should never see you
more,&mdash;never, no, never!"</p>

<p>"I assure you that I shall always think of your good
feeling towards me, Mont Saint-Jean."</p>

<p>"Oh, and to think how I loved you, when I was sitting
there at your feet on the ground! It seemed as if
I was saved,&mdash;that I had nothing more to fear! It
was not for the blows which the other women may, perhaps,
begin again to give me that I said that I have led
a hard life; but it seemed to me that you were my good
fortune, and would bring good luck to my child, just
because you had pity on me. But, then, when one is
used to be ill-treated, one is then more sensible than
others to kindness." Then, interrupting herself, to
burst again into a loud fit of sobs,&mdash;"Well, well, it's
done,&mdash;it's finished,&mdash;all over! And so it must be
some day or other. I was wrong to think any
otherwise. It's done&mdash;done&mdash;done!"</p>

<p>"Courage! Courage! I will think of you, as you
will remember me."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, they may tear me to pieces before
they shall ever make me forget you! I may grow old,&mdash;as
old as the streets,&mdash;but I shall always have your
angel face before me. The first word I will teach my
child shall be your name, Goualeuse; for but for you it
would have perished with cold."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Mont Saint-Jean!" said Fleur-de-Marie,
deeply affected by the attachment of this unhappy
woman. "I cannot promise to do anything for
you, although I know some very charitable persons; but,
for your child, it is a different thing; it is wholly innocent;
and the persons of whom I speak will, perhaps,
take charge of it, and bring it up, when you can resolve
on parting from it."</p>

<p>"Part from it! Never, oh, never!" exclaimed Mont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Saint-Jean, with excitement. "What would become of
me now, when I have so built upon it?"</p>

<p>"But how will you bring it up? Boy or girl, it ought
to be made honest; and for that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It must eat honest bread. I know that, Goualeuse,&mdash;I
believe it. It is my ambition; and I say so to
myself every day. So, in leaving here, I will never put
my foot under a bridge again. I will turn rag-picker,
street-sweeper,&mdash;something honest; for I owe that, if
not to myself, at least to my child, when I have the
honour of having one," she added, with a sort of pride.</p>

<p>"And who will take care of your child whilst you
are at work?" inquired the Goualeuse. "Will it not
be better, if possible, as I hope it will be, to put it in
the country with some worthy people, who will make
a good country girl or a stout farmer's boy of it?
You can come and see it from time to time; and one
day you may, perhaps, find the means to live near it
constantly. In the country, one lives on so little!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but to separate myself from it,&mdash;to separate
myself from it! It would be my only joy,&mdash;I, who
have nothing else in the world to love,&mdash;nothing that
loves me!"</p>

<p>"You must think more of it than of yourself, my poor
Mont Saint-Jean. In two or three days I will write to
Madame Armand, and if the application I mean to make
in favour of your child should succeed, you will have no
occasion to say to it, as you said so painfully just now,
'Alas! What will become of it?'"</p>

<p>Madame Armand interrupted this conversation, and
came to seek Fleur-de-Marie. After having again burst
into sobs, and bathed with her despairing tears the
young girl's hands, Mont Saint-Jean fell on the seat
perfectly overcome, not even thinking of the promise
which Fleur-de-Marie had just made with respect to
her child.</p>

<p>"Poor creature!" said Madame Armand, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
quitted the yard, accompanied by Fleur-de-Marie, "her
gratitude towards you gives me a better opinion of her."</p>

<p>Learning that La Goualeuse was discharged, the other
prisoners, far from envying her this favour, displayed
their delight. Some of them surrounded Fleur-de-Marie,
and took leave of her with adieux full of
cordiality, frankly congratulating her on her speedy
release from prison.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say," said one, "this little fair girl
has made us pass an agreeable moment, when we agreed
to make up the basket of clothes for Mont Saint-Jean.
That will be remembered at St. Lazare."</p>

<p>When Fleur-de-Marie had quitted the prison buildings,
the inspectress said to her:</p>

<p>"Now, my dear child, go to the clothing-room, and
leave your prison clothes. Put on your peasant girl's
clothes, whose rustic simplicity suits you so well.
Adieu! You will be happy, for you are going to be
under the protection of good people, and leave these
walls, never again to return to them. But I am really
hardly reasonable," said Madame Armand, whose eyes
were moistened with tears. "I really cannot conceal
from you how much I am attached to you, my poor
girl!" Then, seeing the tears in Fleur-de-Marie's eyes,
the inspectress added, "But we must not sadden your
departure thus."</p>

<p>"Ah, madame, is it not through your recommendation
that this young lady to whom I owe my liberty has
become interested in me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I am happy that I did so; my presentiments
had not deceived me."</p>

<p>At this moment a clock struck.</p>

<p>"That is the hour of work; I must return to the
rooms. Adieu! Once more adieu, my dear child!"</p>

<p>Madame Armand, as much affected as Fleur-de-Marie,
embraced her tenderly, and then said to one
of the women employed in the establishment:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take mademoiselle to the vestiary."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour afterwards, Fleur-de-Marie,
dressed like a peasant girl, as we have seen her at
the farm at Bouqueval, entered the waiting-room,
where Madame Séraphin was expecting her. The
housekeeper of the notary, Jacques Ferrand, had come
to seek the unhappy girl, and conduct her to the Isle
du Ravageur.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h5>RECOLLECTIONS.</h5>


<p>Jacques Ferrand had quickly and readily obtained
the liberty of Fleur-de-Marie, which, indeed, only required
a simple official order. Instructed by the
Chouette of La Goualeuse being at St. Lazare, he
had immediately applied to one of his clients, an
honourable and influential man, saying that a young
female who had once erred, but afterwards sincerely
repented, being now confined in St. Lazare, was in
danger of forgetting her good resolutions, in consequence
of her association with the other prisoners. This
young girl having been (added the notary) strongly
recommended to him by persons of high respectability,
who wanted to take care of her when she quitted the
prison, he besought his client, in the name of religion,
virtue, and the future return to goodness of the poor
girl, to interest himself in obtaining her liberation.
And, further to screen himself from all chance of
future consequences, the notary most earnestly charged
his client not to allow his name to transpire in the business
on any account, as he was desirous of avoiding any
mention of having been employed in the furtherance of
so good and charitable a work.</p>

<p>This request, which was attributed to the unassuming
modesty and benevolence of Jacques Ferrand, a man
equally esteemed for his piety as for honour and probity,
was strictly complied with, the liberation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Fleur-de-Marie being asked and obtained in the
client's name alone; and by way of evincing a still
greater regard for the shrinking delicacy of the notary's
nature, the order for quitting the prison was sent under
cover to Jacques Ferrand, that he might send it on to
the parties interesting themselves for the young girl.
And when Madame Séraphin presented the order to the
directors of the prison, she stated herself to have been
sent by the parties feeling a desire to save the young
person it referred to.</p>

<p>From the favourable manner in which the matron of
the prison had spoken to Madame d'Harville of Fleur-de-Marie,
not a doubt existed as to its being to that
lady La Goualeuse was indebted for her return to
freedom. There was, therefore, no chance of the
appearance of Madame Séraphin exciting any mistrust
in the mind of her victim. Madame Séraphin
could so well assume the look and manner of what
is commonly styled "a nice motherly kind of person,"
that it required a more than ordinary share of penetration
to discover a strong proportion of falsehood, deceit,
and cunning behind the smooth glance or the hypocritical
smile; but, spite of the hardened villainy with
which she had shared so long and deeply in the nefarious
practices of her employer, Madame Séraphin, old and hackneyed
as she was, could not view without emotion the
exquisite loveliness of the being her own hand had surrendered,
even as a child, to the cruel care of the Chouette,
and whom she was now leading to an inevitable
death.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," cried Madame Séraphin, speaking
in a tone of honeyed sweetness, as Fleur-de-Marie drew
near, "I suppose you are very glad to get away from
prison."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, ma'am. I presume it is Madame
d'Harville who has had the goodness to obtain my
liberty for me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are not mistaken in your guess. But, come, we
are already a little behindhand, and we have still some
distance to go."</p>

<p>"We are going to Madame Georges at the farm at
Bouqueval, are we not, madame?" cried La Goualeuse.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, certainly, by all means!" answered the
<i>femme de charge</i>, in order to avert all suspicion from
the mind of her victim. "Yes, my dear, we are going
into the country, as you say;" and then added, with a
sort of good-humoured teasing, "But that is not all;
before you see Madame Georges, a little surprise awaits
you&mdash;Come, come, our coach is waiting below! Ah,
how you will be astonished by and by! Come, then, let
us go. Your most obedient servant, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>And, with a multitude of bows and salutations from
Madame Séraphin to the registrar, his clerk, and all the
various members of the establishment then and there
assembled, she descended the stairs with La Goualeuse,
followed by an officer, to command the opening of the
gates through which they had to pass. The last had
just closed behind them, and the two females found
themselves beneath the vast porch which looks out upon
the street of the Faubourg St. Denis, when they nearly
ran against a young female, who appeared hurrying
towards the prison, as though full of anxiety to visit
one of its inmates. It was Rigolette, as pretty and
light-footed as ever, her charming face set off by a
simple yet becoming cap, tastefully ornamented with
cherry-coloured riband; while her dark brown hair
was laid in bright glossy bands down each clear and
finely rounded cheek. She was wrapped in a plaid
shawl, over which fell a snowy muslin collar, secured
by a small knot of riband. On her arm she carried
a straw basket; while, thanks to her light, careful way
of picking her steps, her thick-soled boots were scarcely
soiled; and yet the poor girl had walked far that
day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rigolette!" exclaimed Fleur-de-Marie, as she recognised
her old prison companion, and the sharer in her
rural excursions.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The reader will, perhaps, recollect that in the recital made by La Goualeuse
to Rodolph, at their first meeting at the ogress's, of the early events
of her life, she spoke to him of Rigolette, who, a friendless child like herself,
had been (with her) confined in a <i>maison de detention</i> until she had reached the
age of sixteen.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"La Goualeuse!" returned the grisette, and with one
accord the two girls threw themselves into each other's
arms.</p>

<p>Nothing more touchingly beautiful could be imagined
than the contrast between these two young creatures,
both so lovely, though differing so entirely from one
another in appearance: the one exquisitely fair, with
large, melancholy blue eyes, and an outline of feature
of faultless purity, the pale, pensive, intellectual cast
of the whole countenance reminding the observer of
one of those sweet designs of a village maid by
Greuze,&mdash;the same clear delicacy of complexion, the
same ineffable mixture of graceful pensiveness and
candid innocence; the other a sparkling brunette,
with round rosy cheek and bright black eyes, set off by
a laughing, dimpled face and mirthful air,&mdash;the very
impersonation of youthful gaiety and light-heartedness,
the rare and touching specimen of happy poverty,
of contented labour, and honest industry!</p>

<p>After the first burst of their affectionate greetings had
passed away, the two girls regarded each other with close
and tender scrutiny. The features of Rigolette were radiant
with the joy she experienced at this unexpected meeting;
Fleur-de-Marie, on the contrary, felt humbled and
confused at the sight of her early friend, which recalled
but too vividly to her mind the few days of
peaceful calm she had known previous to her first
degradation.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Goualeuse!" exclaimed the grisette,
fixing her bright eyes with intense delight on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
companion. "To think of meeting you at last, after so
long an absence!"</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, a delightful surprise!" replied Fleur-de-Marie.
"It is so very long since we have seen each
other."</p>

<p>"Ah, but now," said Rigolette, for the first time
remarking the rustic habiliments of La Goualeuse, "I
can account for seeing nothing of you during the last
six months,&mdash;you live in the country, I see?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Fleur-de-Marie, casting down her
eyes, "I have done so for some time past."</p>

<p>"And I suppose that, like me, you have come to see
some friend in this prison?"</p>

<p>"Yes," stammered poor Fleur-de-Marie, blushing up
to her eyes with shame and confusion; "I was going&mdash;I
mean I have just been seeing some one, and, of course,
am now returning home."</p>

<p>"You live a good way out of Paris, I dare say? Ah,
you dear, kind girl! It is just like you to come all this
distance to perform a good action. Do you remember
the poor lying-in woman to whom you gave, not only
your mattress, with the necessary baby-clothes, but even
what money you had left, and which we meant to have
spent in a country excursion; for you were then crazy
for the country, my pretty village maid?"</p>

<p>"And you, who cared nothing about it, how very good-natured
and obliging of you to go thither, merely for the
sake of pleasing me!"</p>

<p>"Well, but I pleased myself at the same time. Why,
you, who were always inclined to be grave and serious,
when once you got among the fields, or found yourself
in the thick shade of a wood, oh, then, what a wild,
overjoyed little madcap you became! Nobody would
have fancied it the same person,&mdash;flying after the
butterflies,&mdash;crowding your hands and apron with
more flowers than either could hold. It made me
quite delighted to see you! It was quite treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
enough for a week to recollect all your happiness and
enjoyment. But do let me have another look at you:
how sweetly pretty you look in that nice little round
cap! Yes, decidedly, you were cut out to be
a country girl,&mdash;just as much as I was to be a Paris
grisette. Well, I hope you are happy, since you have
got the sort of line you prefer; and, certainly, after all,
I cannot say I was so very much astonished at your
never coming near me. 'Oh,' said I, 'that dear Goualeuse
is not suited for Paris; she is a true wild flower,
as the song says; and the air of great cities is not
for them. So,' said I, 'my pretty, dear Goualeuse has
found a place in some good honest family who live in
the country.' And I was right, was I not, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fleur-de-Marie, nearly sinking with confusion,
"quite right."</p>

<p>"There is only one thing I have to reproach you for."</p>

<p>"Reproach me?" inquired Fleur-de-Marie, looking
tearfully at her companion.</p>

<p>"Yes, you ought to have let me know before you
went. You should have said 'good-bye,' if you were
only leaving me at night to return in the morning; or,
at any rate, you should have sent me word how you
were going on."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;quitted Paris so suddenly," stammered out
Fleur-de-Marie, becoming momentarily more and more
embarrassed, "that, indeed&mdash;I&mdash;was not able&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not at all angry! I don't speak of it to
scold you! I am far too happy in meeting you unexpectedly;
and, besides, I commend you for getting out
of such a dangerous place as Paris, where it is so difficult
to earn a quiet livelihood; for, you know, two poor
friendless girls like you and me might be led into
mischief, without thinking of, or intending, any harm.
When there is no person to advise, it leaves one so
very defenceless; and then come a parcel of deceitful,
flattering men, with their false promises, when, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
want and misery are staring you in the face. There,
for instance, do you recollect that pretty girl called
Julie?&mdash;and Rosine, who had such a beautiful fair
skin, and such coal black eyes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I recollect them very well!"</p>

<p>"Then, my dear Goualeuse, you will be extremely
sorry to hear that they were both led astray, seduced,
and deserted, till at last, from one unfortunate step to
another, they have become like the miserable creatures
confined in this prison!"</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven!" exclaimed Fleur-de-Marie, hanging
down her head, and blushing the deep blush of shame.</p>

<p>Rigolette, misinterpreting the real cause of her friend's
exclamation, continued:</p>

<p>"I admit that their conduct is wrong, nay wicked;
but then, you know, my dear Goualeuse, because you
and I have been so fortunate as to preserve ourselves
from harm,&mdash;you, because you have been living with
good and virtuous people in the country, out of the
reach of temptation; and I, because I had no time to
waste in listening to a set of make-believe lovers; and
also because I found greater pleasure in having a few
birds, and in trying to get things a little comfortable
and snug around me,&mdash;I say, it is not for you and me
to be too severe with others; and God alone knows
whether opportunity, deceit, and destitution may not
have had much to do in causing the misery and disgrace
of Julie and Rosine! And who can say whether, in
their place, we might not have acted as they have done?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried Fleur-de-Marie, "I accuse them not;
on the contrary, I pity them from my heart!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dear child!" interrupted Madame
Séraphin, impatiently offering her arm to her victim,
"you forget that I said we were already behind our time."</p>

<p>"Pray, madame, grant us a little more time," said
Rigolette. "It is so very long since I saw my dear
Goualeuse!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should be glad to do so," replied Madame Séraphin,
much annoyed at this meeting between the two friends;
"but it is now three o'clock, and we have a long way to
go. However, I will manage to allow you ten minutes
longer gossip. So pray make the best of your time."</p>

<p>"And tell me, I pray, of yourself," said Fleur-de-Marie,
affectionately pressing the hands of Rigolette
between her own. "Are you still the same merry,
light-hearted, and happy creature I always knew
you?"</p>

<p>"I was happy and gay enough a few days ago; but
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You sorrowful? I can hardly believe it."</p>

<p>"Ah, but indeed I am! Not that I am at all
changed from what you always found me,&mdash;a regular
Roger Bontemps,&mdash;one to whom nothing was a trouble.
But then, you see, everybody is not like me; so that,
when I see those I love unhappy, why, naturally, that
makes me unhappy, too."</p>

<p>"Still the same kind, warm-hearted girl!"</p>

<p>"Why, who could help being grieved as I am? Just
imagine my having come hither to visit a poor young
creature,&mdash;a sort of neighbouring lodger in the house
where I live,&mdash;as meek and mild as a lamb she was,
poor thing! Well, she has been most shamefully and
unjustly accused,&mdash;that she has; never mind of what
just now! Her name is Louise Morel. She is the
daughter of an honest and deserving man, a lapidary,
who has gone mad in consequence of her being put in
prison."</p>

<p>At the name of Louise Morel, one of the victims of
the notary's villainy, Madame Séraphin started, and
gazed earnestly at Rigolette. The features of the grisette
were, however, perfectly unknown to her; nevertheless,
from that instant, the <i>femme de charge</i> listened with
an attentive ear to the conversation of the two girls.</p>

<p>"Poor thing," continued the Goualeuse; "how happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
it must make her to find that you have not forgotten
her in her misfortunes!"</p>

<p>"And that is not all; it really seems as though some
spell hung over me! But, truly and positively, this is
the second poor prisoner I have left my home to-day to
visit! I have come a long way, and also from a prison,&mdash;but
that was a place of confinement for men."</p>

<p>"You, Rigolette,&mdash;in a prison for men?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, indeed. I have a very dejected customer
there, I can assure you. There,&mdash;you see my
basket; it is divided in two parts, and each of my poor
friends has an equal share in its contents. I have got
some clean things here for poor Louise, and I have left
a similar packet with Germain,&mdash;that is the name of
my other poor captive. I cannot help feeling ready to
cry when I think of our last interview. I know it will
do no good, but still, for all that, the tears will come
into my eyes."</p>

<p>"But what is it that distresses you so much?"</p>

<p>"Why, because, you see, poor Germain frets so much
at being mixed up in his prison with the many bad characters
that are there, that it has quite broken his spirits;
he seems to have no taste, no relish for anything, has
quite lost his appetite, and is wasting away daily. So,
when I perceived the change, I said to myself: 'Oh,
poor fellow, I see he eats nothing. I must make him
something nice and delicate to tempt his appetite a
little; he shall have one of those little dainties he used
to be so fond of when he and I were next-room neighbours.'
When I say dainties, of course I don't mean
such as rich people expect by that name. No, no, my
dish was merely some beautiful mealy potatoes, mashed
with a little milk and sugar. Well, my dear Goualeuse,
I prepared this for him, put it in a nice little china basin
and took it to him in his prison, telling him I had
brought him a little titbit he used once to be fond of,
and which I hoped he would like as well as in former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
days. I told him I had prepared it entirely myself,
hoping to make him relish it. But alas, no! What do
you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what?"</p>

<p>"Why, instead of increasing his appetite, I only set
him crying; for, when I displayed my poor attempts at
cookery, he seemed to take no notice of anything but the
basin, out of which he had been accustomed to see me
take my milk when we supped together; and then he
burst into tears, and, by way of making matters still
better, I began to cry, too, although I tried all I could
to restrain myself. You see how everything went
against me. I had gone with the intention of enlivening
his spirits, and, instead of that, there I was
making him more melancholy than ever."</p>

<p>"Still, the tears he shed were, no doubt, sweet and
consoling tears!"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind what sort of tears they were, that
was not the way I meant to have consoled him. But la!
All this while I am talking to you of Germain as if you
knew him. He is an old acquaintance of mine, one of
the best young men in the world, as timid and gentle as
any young girl could be, and whom I loved as a friend
and a brother."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, of course, his troubles became yours
also."</p>

<p>"To be sure. But just let me show you what a good
heart he must have. When I was coming away, I asked
him as usual what orders he had for me, saying jokingly,
by way of making him smile, that I was his little housekeeper,
and that I should be very punctual and exact in
fulfilling whatever commissions he gave me, in order to
remain in his employ. So then he, trying to smile in
his turn, asked me to bring him one of Walter Scott's
romances, which he had formerly read to me while I
worked,&mdash;that romance was called 'Ivan&mdash;' 'Ivanhoe,'
that's it. I was so much amused with this book that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Germain read it twice over to me. Poor Germain!
How very, very kind and attentive he was!"</p>

<p>"I suppose he wished to keep it as a reminiscence of
bygone days?"</p>

<p>"No doubt of it; for he bade me go to the library
from whence we had had it, and to purchase the very
same volumes that had so much entertained us, and
which we had read together,&mdash;not merely to hire them,&mdash;yes,
positively to buy them out and out; and you
may imagine that was something of a sacrifice for him,
for he is no richer than you or I."</p>

<p>"He must have a noble and excellent heart to have
thought of it," said the Goualeuse, deeply touched.</p>

<p>"I declare you are as much affected by it as I was, my
dear, kind Goualeuse! But then, you see, the more I
felt ready to cry, the more I tried to laugh; for, to shed
tears twice during a visit, intended to be so very cheering
and enlivening as mine was, was rather too bad. So,
to drive all those thoughts out of my head, I began to
remind him of the amusing story of a Jew,&mdash;a person
we read about in the romance I was telling you of. But
the more I rattled away, and the greater nonsense I
tried to talk, the faster the large round tears gathered
in his eyes, and he kept looking at me with such an
expression of misery as quite broke my heart. And so&mdash;and
so&mdash;at last my voice quite failed me, and I could
do nothing but mingle my sobs with his. He had not
regained his composure when I left him, and I felt quite
provoked with myself for my folly. 'If that is the way,'
said I,'that I comfort and cheer up poor Germain, I
think I had better stay away!' Really, when I remember
all the fine things I intended to have said and done,
by way of keeping up his spirits, I feel quite spiteful
towards myself for having so completely failed."</p>

<p>At the name of Germain, another victim of the
notary's unprincipled persecution, Madame Séraphin
redoubled her before close attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what has this poor young man done to deserve
being put in prison?" inquired Fleur-de-Marie.</p>

<p>"What has he done?" exclaimed Rigolette, whose
grief became swallowed up in indignation; "why, he has
had the misfortune to fall into the hands of a wicked old
notary,&mdash;the same as persecutes poor Louise."</p>

<p>"Of her whom you have come to see?"</p>

<p>"To be sure; she lived as servant with this notary,
and Germain was also with him as cashier. It is too
long a story to tell you now, how or of what he unjustly
accuses the poor fellow; but one thing is quite certain,
and that is, that the wretch of a notary pursues these
two unfortunate beings, who have never done him the
least harm, with the most determined malice and hatred.
However, never mind,&mdash;a little patience, 'every one in
their turn,'&mdash;that's all." Rigolette uttered these last
words with a peculiarity of manner and expression that
created considerable uneasiness in the mind of Madame
Séraphin. Instead, therefore, of preserving the distance
she had hitherto observed, she at once joined in the conversation,
saying to Fleur-de-Marie, with a kind and
maternal air:</p>

<p>"My dear girl, it is really growing too late for us to
wait any longer,&mdash;we must go; we are waited for, I
assure you, with much anxiety. I am sorry to hurry
you away, because I can well imagine how much you
must be interested in what your friend is relating; for
even I, who know nothing of the two young persons she
refers to, cannot help feeling my very heart ache for
their undeserved sufferings. Is it possible there can be
people in the world as wicked as the notary you were
mentioning? Pray, my dear mademoiselle, what may
be the name of this bad man,&mdash;if I may make so bold
as to ask?"</p>

<p>Although Rigolette entertained not the slightest suspicion
of the sincerity of Madame Séraphin's affected
sympathy, yet, recollecting how strictly Rodolph had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
enjoined her to observe the utmost secrecy respecting
the protection he bestowed on both Germain and Louise,
she regretted having been led away by her affectionate
zeal for her friends to use such words,&mdash;"Patience;
every one has his turn!"</p>

<p>"His name, madame, is Ferrand,&mdash;M. Jacques Ferrand,
Notary," replied Rigolette, skilfully adding, by way
of compensation for her indiscreet warmth, "and it is
the more wicked and shameful of him to torment Louise
and Germain as he does, because the poor things have
not a friend upon earth but myself, and, God knows,
it is little I can do besides wishing them well out of
their troubles!"</p>

<p>"Dear me,&mdash;poor things!" observed Madame Séraphin.
"Well, I'm sure I hoped it was otherwise when I
heard you say, 'Patience; every one has their turn!'
I supposed you reckoned for certain upon some powerful
protector to defend these people against that dreadful
notary."</p>

<p>"Alas, no, madame!" answered Rigolette, hoping to
destroy any suspicion Madame Séraphin might still harbour;
"such, I am sorry to say, is not the case. For
who would be generous and disinterested enough to take
the part of two poor creatures like my unfortunate friends
against a rich and powerful man like M. Ferrand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are many good and noble-minded persons
capable of performing so good an action," pursued Fleur-de-Marie,
after a moment's consideration, and with ill-restrained
excitement; "I myself know one to whom it
is equally a duty and a pleasure to succour and assist all
who are in need or difficulty,&mdash;one who is beloved and
valued by all good persons, as he is dreaded and hated
by the bad."</p>

<p>Rigolette gazed on the Goualeuse with deep astonishment,
and was just on the point of asserting that she,
too (alluding to Rodolph), knew some one capable of
courageously espousing the cause of the weak against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the strong; but, faithful to the injunctions of her
neighbour (as she styled the prince), she contented
herself with merely saying, "Really, do you indeed
know anybody capable of generously coming forward
in defence of poor oppressed individuals, such as we
have been talking of?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do. And, although I have already to
solicit his goodness in favour of others also in severe
trouble, yet, I am quite sure that, did he but know of
the undeserved misfortunes of Louise and Germain, he
would both rescue them from misery and punish their
wicked persecutor; for his goodness and justice are
inexhaustible."</p>

<p>Madame Séraphin surveyed her victim with surprise.
"This girl," said she, mentally, "might be even more
dangerous than we thought for. And, even if I had
been weak enough to feel inclined to pity her, what I
have just heard would have rendered the little 'accident,'
which is to rid us of her, quite inevitable."</p>

<p>"Then, dear Goualeuse, since you have so valuable an
acquaintance, I beseech of you to recommend poor Louise
and Germain to his notice," said Rigolette, wisely considering
that her two protégées would be all the better
for obtaining two protectors instead of one. "And pray
say that they do not in the least deserve their present
wretched fate."</p>

<p>"Make yourself perfectly easy," returned Fleur-de-Marie;
"I promise to try to interest M. Rodolph in
favour of your poor friends."</p>

<p>"Who did you say?" exclaimed Rigolette, "M. Rodolph?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied La Goualeuse; "do you know him?"</p>

<p>"M. Rodolph?" again repeated Rigolette, perfectly
bewildered; "is he a travelling clerk?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know what he is. But why are you
so much astonished?"</p>

<p>"Because I know a M. Rodolph!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps it is not the same."</p>

<p>"Well, describe yours. What is he like?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, he is young."</p>

<p>"So is mine."</p>

<p>"With a countenance full of nobleness and goodness."</p>

<p>"Precisely," exclaimed Rigolette, whose amazement
increased. "Oh, it must be the very man! Is your M.
Rodolph rather dark-complexioned, with a small moustache?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"Is he tall and thin, with a beautiful figure, and quite
a fashionable, gentlemanly sort of air,&mdash;wonderfully so,
considering he is but a clerk? Now, then, does your M.
Rodolph answer to that description?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," answered Fleur-de-Marie; "and I feel
quite sure that we both mean the same. The only thing
that puzzles me is your fancying he is a clerk."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I know he is. He told me so himself."</p>

<p>"And you know him intimately?"</p>

<p>"Why, he is my next-door neighbour."</p>

<p>"M. Rodolph is?"</p>

<p>"I mean next-room neighbour; because he occupies
an apartment on the fourth floor, next to mine."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;M. Rodolph&mdash;lodges in the next room to
you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. But what do you find so astonishing in
a thing as simple as that? He only earns about fifteen
or eighteen hundred francs a year, and, of course, he
could not afford a more expensive lodging,&mdash;though,
certainly, he does not strike me as being a very careful
or economical person; for, bless his dear heart, he actually
does not know the price of the clothes he wears."</p>

<p>"No, no, it cannot be the same M. Rodolph I am
acquainted with," said Fleur-de-Marie, reflecting seriously;
"oh, no, quite impossible!"</p>

<p>"I suppose yours is a pattern of order and exactness?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"He of whom I spoke, I must tell you, Rigolette,"
said Fleur-de-Marie, with enthusiasm, "is all-powerful;
his name is never pronounced but with love and veneration;
there is something awe-inspiring in his very aspect,
giving one the desire to kneel in his presence and offer
humble respect to his goodness and greatness."</p>

<p>"Ah, then, it is no use trying the comparison any further,
my dear Goualeuse; for my M. Rodolph is neither
powerful, great, nor imposing. He is very good-natured
and merry, and all that; but oh, bless you, as for being
a person one would be likely to go on one's knees to, why,
he is quite the reverse. He cares no more for ceremony
than I do, and even promised me to come and help
me clean my apartment and polish the floor. And then,
instead of being awe-inspiring, he settled with me to
take me out of a Sunday anywhere I liked to go. So
that, you see, he can't be a very great person. But,
bless you, what am I thinking of? It seems as if my
heart were wholly engrossed by my Sunday pleasures,
instead of recollecting these poor creatures shut up and
deprived of their liberty in a prison. Ah, poor dear
Louise&mdash;and poor Germain, too! Until they are restored
to freedom there is no happiness for me!"</p>

<p>For several minutes Fleur-de-Marie remained plunged
in a deep reverie; she all at once recalled to her remembrance
that, at her first interview with Rodolph, at the
house of the ogress, his language and manners resembled
those of the usual frequenters of the <i>tapis-franc</i>. Was
it not, then, possible that he might be playing the part
of the travelling clerk, for the sake of some scheme he
had in view? The difficulty consisted in finding any
probable cause for such a transformation. The grisette,
who quickly perceived the thoughtful meditation in which
Fleur-de-Marie was lost, said, kindly:</p>

<p>"Never mind puzzling your poor brains on the subject,
my dear Goualeuse; we shall soon find out whether we
both know the same M. Rodolph. When you see yours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
speak of me to him; when I see mine, I will mention
you; by these means we shall easily discover what conclusion
to come to."</p>

<p>"Where do you live, Rigolette?"</p>

<p>"No. 17 Rue du Temple."</p>

<p>"Come!" said Madame Séraphin (who had attentively
listened to all this conversation) to herself, "that
is not a bad thing to know. This all-powerful and mysterious
personage, M. Rodolph, who is, no doubt, passing
himself off for a travelling clerk, occupies an apartment
adjoining that of this young mantua-maker, who appears
to me to know much more than she chooses to own to;
and this defender of the oppressed, it seems, is lodging
in the same house with Morel and Bradamanti. Well,
well, if the grisette and the travelling clerk continue to
meddle with what does not concern them, I shall know
where to lay my hand upon them."</p>

<p>"As soon as ever I have spoken with M. Rodolph,"
said the Goualeuse, "I will write to you, and give you
my address where to send your answer; but tell me
yours over again, I am afraid of forgetting it."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, how fortunate! I declare I have got one
of my cards with me! I remember a person I work for
asked me to leave her one, to give a friend who wished
to employ me. So I brought it out for that purpose;
but I will give it to you, and carry her one another
time." And here Rigolette handed to Fleur-de-Marie
a small card, on which was written, in beautiful text-hand,
"Mademoiselle Rigolette, Dressmaker, 17 Rue du
Temple." "There's a beauty!" continued the grisette.
"Oh, isn't it nicely done? Better, a good deal, than
printing! Ah, poor dear Germain wrote me a number
of cards long ago! Oh, he was so kind, so attentive!
I don't know how it could have happened that I never
found out half his good qualities till he became unfortunate;
and now I continually reproach myself with
having learned to love him so late."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"You love Germain, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that I do! Why, you know, I must have
some pretext for visiting him in prison. Am I not an
odd sort of girl?" said Rigolette, choking a rising sigh,
and smiling, like an April shower, amid the tears which
glittered in her large dark eyes.</p>

<p>"You are good and generous-hearted, as you ever
were!" said Fleur-de-Marie, tenderly pressing her friend's
hands within her own.</p>

<p>Madame Séraphin had evidently learned all she cared
to know, and feeling very little interest in any further
disclosure of Rigolette's love for young Germain, hastily
approaching Fleur-de-Marie, she abruptly said:</p>

<p>"Come, my dear child, do not keep me waiting another
minute, I beg; it is very late, and I shall be
scolded, as it is, for being so much behind my time; we
have trifled away a good quarter of an hour, and must
endeavour to make up for it."</p>

<p>"What a nasty cross old body that is!" said Rigolette,
in a whisper, to Fleur-de-Marie. "I don't like the looks
of her at all!" Then, speaking in a louder voice, she
added, "Whenever you come to Paris, my dear Goualeuse,
be sure to come and see me. I should be so delighted to
have you all to myself for a whole day, to show you my
little home and my birds; for I have got some, such
sweet pretty ones! Oh, that is my chief indulgence and
expense!"</p>

<p>"I will try to come and see you, but certainly I will
write you. So good-bye, my dear, dear Rigolette! Adieu!
Oh, if you only knew how happy I feel at having met
with you again!"</p>

<p>"And, I am sure, so do I; but I trust we shall soon
see each other again; and, besides, I am so impatient to
know whether your M. Rodolph is the same as mine.
Pray write to me very soon upon this subject, will you?
Promise you will!"</p>

<p>"Indeed I will! Adieu, dear Rigolette!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Farewell, my very dear Goualeuse!"</p>

<p>And again the two poor girls, each striving to conceal
their distress at parting, indulged in a long and affectionate
embrace. Rigolette then turned away, to enter the
prison for the purpose of visiting Louise, according to
the kind permission obtained for her by Rodolph, while
Fleur-de-Marie, with Madame Séraphin, got into the
coach which was waiting for them. The coachman was
instructed to proceed to Batignolles, and to stop at the
barrier. A cross-road of inconsiderable length conducted
from this spot almost directly to the borders of the Seine,
not far from the Isle du Ravageur. Wholly unacquainted
with the locality of Paris, Fleur-de-Marie was unable to
detect that the vehicle did not take the road to the Barrier
St. Denis; it was only when the coach stopped at
Batignolles, and she was requested by Madame Séraphin
to alight, that she said:</p>

<p>"It seems to me, madame, that we are not in the
road to Bouqueval; and how shall we be able to walk
from hence to the farm?"</p>

<p>"All that I can tell you, my dear child," answered the
<i>femme de charge</i>, kindly, "is, that I am obeying their
orders given me by your benefactors, and that you will
pain them greatly if you keep your friends waiting."</p>

<p>"Oh, not for worlds would I be so presuming and
ungrateful as to oppose their slightest wish!" exclaimed
poor Fleur-de-Marie, with kindling warmth, "and I beseech
you, madame, to pardon my seeming hesitation;
but, since you plead the commands of my revered protectors,
depend upon my following you blindly and
silently whithersoever you are pleased to take me. Only
tell me, is Madame Georges quite well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in most excellent health and spirits!"</p>

<p>"And M. Rodolph?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly well, also."</p>

<p>"Then you know him? But, madame, when I was
speaking to Rigolette concerning him just now, you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
not seem to be acquainted with him; at least, you did
not say so."</p>

<p>"Because, in pursuance with the directions given me,
I affected to be ignorant of the person you alluded to."</p>

<p>"And did M. Rodolph, himself, give you those orders?"</p>

<p>"Why, what a dear, curious little thing this is!" said
the <i>femme de charge</i>, smilingly; "I must mind what I
am about, or, with her innocent ways of putting questions,
she will find out all my secrets!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, madame, I am ashamed of seeming so inquisitive,
but if you could only imagine how my heart
beats with joy at the bare thoughts of seeing my beloved
friends again, you would pardon me; but, as we have
only to walk on to the place whither you are taking me,
I shall soon be able to gratify my wishes, without tormenting
you by further inquiries."</p>

<p>"To be sure you will, my dear, for I promise you that
in a quarter of an hour we shall have reached the end
of our journey."</p>

<p>The <i>femme de charge</i>, having now left behind the last
houses in the village of Batignolles, conducted Fleur-de-Marie
across a grassy road, bordered on each side by
lofty walnut-trees. The day was warm and fine, the sky
half covered by the rich purple clouds of the setting sun,
which now cast its declining rays on the heights of the
<i>colombes</i>, situated on the other side of the Seine. As
Fleur-de-Marie approached the banks of the river, a delicate
bloom tinged her pale cheeks, and she seemed to
breathe with delight the pure fresh air that blew from
the country. Indeed, so strongly was the look of happiness
imprinted on her countenance, that even Madame
Séraphin could not avoid noticing it.</p>

<p>"You seem full of joy, my dear child; I declare it is
quite a pleasure to see you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, I am overflowing with gratitude and
eagerness at the thoughts of seeing my dear Madame
Georges so soon, and perhaps, too, M. Rodolph! I trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
I may, for, besides my own happiness at beholding him,
I want to speak to him in favour of several poor unfortunate
persons I should be so glad to recommend to his
kindness and protection. How, then, can I be sad when
I have so many delightful things to look forward to?
Oh, who could be unhappy, with such a prospect as mine?
And see, too, how gay and beautiful the sky is, all covered
with bright, golden clouds! And the dear soft green
grass,&mdash;I think it seems greener than ever, spite of the
season. And look&mdash;look out there! See, where the
river flows behind those willow-trees! Oh, how wide
and sparkling it seems; and, when the sun shines on it,
it almost dazzles my eyes to gaze on it! It seems like a
sheet of gold. Ah, I saw it shining in the same way in
the basin of the prison a little while ago! God does not
forget even the poor prisoners, but allows them to have a
sight of his wondrous works. Though they are separated
by high stone walls from their fellow creatures, the glorious
sun shows them his golden face, and sparkles and
glitters upon the water there, the same as in the gardens
of a king!" added Fleur-de-Marie, with pious gratitude.
Then, incited by a reference to her captivity still more to
appreciate the charms of liberty, she exclaimed, with a
burst of innocent delight: "Oh, pray, madame, do look
there, just in the middle of the river, at that pretty little
island, bordered with willows and poplars, and that sweet
little white house, almost close to the water's edge! How
delicious it must be to live there in the summer, when
all the leaves are on the trees and the birds sing so
sweetly among the branches! Oh, how quiet and cool it
must be in that nice place!"</p>

<p>"Well, really, now, my dear," said Madame Séraphin,
with a grim smile, "it is singular enough your being so
much struck with that little isle!"</p>

<p>"Why, madame?"</p>

<p>"Because it is there we are actually going to."</p>

<p>"Going to that island?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; does that astonish you?"</p>

<p>"Rather so, madame."</p>

<p>"But suppose you found your friends there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Suppose, I say, you found all your friends had assembled
there, to welcome you on your release from
prison, should you not then be greatly surprised?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if it were but possible! My dear Madame
Georges?&mdash;M. Rodolph?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, my dear, I am just like a baby in
your hands, and you turn and twist me just as you please;
it is useless for me to try to conceal anything, for, with
your little winning ways, you find out all secrets."</p>

<p>"Then I shall soon see them again? Dear madame,
how can I ever thank you sufficiently for your goodness
to a poor girl like me? Feel how my heart beats! It is
all with joy and happiness!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, my love, be as wild with delight as you
please, but pray do not hurry on so very fast. You forget,
you little mad thing, that my old bones cannot run
as fast as your nimble young feet."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, madame; but I cannot help being
quite impatient to arrive where we are going."</p>

<p>"To be sure you cannot; don't fancy I mean to blame
you for it; quite the contrary."</p>

<p>"The road slopes a little now, madame, and it is rather
rough, too; will you accept of my arm to assist you
down?"</p>

<p>"I never refuse a good offer, my dear; for I am somewhat
infirm, as well as old, while you are young and
active."</p>

<p>"Then pray lean all your weight on me, madame;
don't be afraid of tiring me."</p>

<p>"Many thanks, my child! Your help was really very
serviceable, for the descent is so extremely rapid just
here. Now, then, we are once more on smooth, level
ground."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, madame, can it, indeed, be true that I am about
to meet my dear Madame Georges? I can scarcely
persuade myself it is reality."</p>

<p>"A little patience,&mdash;another quarter of an hour, and
then you will see whether it is true or false."</p>

<p>"But what puzzles me," said Fleur-de-Marie, after a
moment's reflection, "is, why Madame Georges should
have thought proper to meet me here, instead of at the
farm."</p>

<p>"Still curious, my dear child, still wanting to know
everybody's reasons."</p>

<p>"How very foolish and unreasonable I am, am I not,
madame?" said Fleur-de-Marie, smiling.</p>

<p>"And, by way of punishing you, I have a great mind
to tell you what the surprise is that your friends have
prepared for you."</p>

<p>"For me, madame, a surprise?"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, you little chatterbox! You will make me
reveal the secret, in spite of myself."</p>

<p>We shall now leave Madame Séraphin and her victim
proceeding along the road which led to the river's side,
while we precede them, by a few minutes, to the Isle du
Ravageur.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<h5>THE BOATS.</h5>


<p>During the night the appearance of the isle inhabited
by the Martial family was very gloomy, but by the bright
light of day nothing could be more smiling than this
accursed spot. Bordered by willows and poplars, almost
entirely covered with thick grass, in which wound several
paths of yellow sand, the islet included a kitchen-garden
and a good number of fruit-trees. In the midst of the
orchard was to be seen the hovel, with the thatched roof,
into which Martial had expressed his intention to retire
with François and Amandine. On this side, the isle
terminated at its point by a kind of stockade, formed of
large piles, driven in to prevent the soil from wearing
away.</p>

<p>In front of the house, and almost touching the landing-place,
was a small arbour of green trellis-work,
intended to support in summer-time the creeping shoots
of the young vines and hops,&mdash;a cradle of verdure, beneath
which were arranged tables for the visitors. At
one end of the house, painted white and covered with
tiles, a wood-house, with a loft over it, formed at the
angle a small wing, much lower than the main body of
the building. Almost precisely over this wing there
appeared a window, with the shutters covered with iron
plates, and strengthened without by two transverse iron
bars attached to the wall by strong clamps.</p>

<p>Three boats were undulating in the water, fastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
posts at the landing-place. Seated in one of these boats,
Nicholas was making sure that the valve he had introduced
performed its part properly. Standing on a bench
at the mouth of the arbour, Calabash, with her hands
placed over her eyes so as to shade away the sun, was
looking out in the direction in which Madame Séraphin
and Fleur-de-Marie were to come to reach the isle.</p>

<p>"I don't see any one yet, old or young," said Calabash,
getting off the bench and speaking to Nicholas.
"It will be just as it was yesterday; we may as well
wait for the King of Prussia. If these women do not
come in half an hour, we can't wait any longer; Bras-Rouge's
'dodge' is much better, and he'll be waiting for
us. The diamond-matcher is to be at his place in the
Champs Elysées at five o'clock. We ought to be there
before her; the Chouette said so this morning."</p>

<p>"You are right," replied Nicholas, leaving the boat.
"May thunder smite the old devil's kin, who has given
us all the trouble for nothing! The valve works capitally.
It appears we shall only have one instead of two
jobs."</p>

<p>"Besides, Bras-Rouge and Barbillon will want us;
they can do nothing by their two selves."</p>

<p>"True, again; for, whilst the job is doing, Bras-Rouge
must keep watch outside the cabaret, and Barbillon is
not strong enough to drag the matcher into the cellar,
for the old &mdash;&mdash; will fight for it, I know!"</p>

<p>"Didn't the Chouette say that, for a joke, she had got
the Schoolmaster at 'school' in the cellar?"</p>

<p>"Not in this one; in another much deeper, and which
is filled with water at spring-tides."</p>

<p>"How the Schoolmaster must rage and foam there in
the cellar! There all alone, and blind, too!"</p>

<p>"That is no matter, for, if he saw as clear as ever,
he could see nothing there; the cellar is as dark as an
oven."</p>

<p>"Still, when he has done singing all the songs he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
knows, to pass away the time, his days must hang
precious heavy on his hands."</p>

<p>"The Chouette says that he amuses himself with rat-hunting,
and that the cellar is full of game."</p>

<p>"I say, Nicholas, talking of certain persons who must
be tired, and fume, and fret," remarked Calabash, with
a savage smile, and pointing to the window fastened up
with the iron plates, "there is one there who must be
ready to devour his own flesh and blood."</p>

<p>"Bah! He's asleep. Since the morning he hasn't
stirred, and his dog is silent."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has strangled him for food. For two
days, they must both be desperate hungry and thirsty up
there together."</p>

<p>"That is their affair. Martial may still last a long
time in this way, if it amuses him. When it is done,
why, we shall say he died of his complaint, and there'll
be an end of that affair."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. As mother went to Asnières this
morning, she met Père Férot, the fisherman, and, as he
was very much astonished at not having seen his friend
Martial for the last two days, mother told him that Martial
was confined to his bed, and was so ill that his life
was despaired of. Daddy Férot swallowed all, like so
much honey; he'll tell everybody else, and when the
thing's done and over, why, it'll all seem nat'ral
enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he won't die directly; this way is a tedious
one."</p>

<p>"What else is to be done? There was no way of
doing otherwise. That devil of a Martial, when he's
put up, is as full of mischief as the old one himself, and
as strong as a bull; particularly when he suspects anything,
it is dangerous to approach him; but, now his
door is well nailed up on the outside, what can he do?
His window is strongly fastened with iron, too."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, he might have driven out the bars by cutting
away the plaster with his knife, and he would have done
it, only I got up the ladder, and chopped at his fingers
with the bill-hook every time he tried to go to work."</p>

<p>"What a pleasant watch!" said the ruffian, with a
chuckle; "it must have been vastly amusing!"</p>

<p>"Why, it was to give you time to come with the iron
plates you went to get from Père Micou."</p>

<p>"What a rage the dear brother must have been
in!"</p>

<p>"He ground his teeth like a lunatic. Two or three
times he tried to drive me away from the iron bars with
his stick, but then, as he had only one hand at liberty,
he could not work and release the iron bars, which was
what he was trying at."</p>

<p>"Fortunately, there's no fireplace in his room, and the
door is solid, and his hands finely cut; if not, he would
work his way through the floor."</p>

<p>"What! Through those heavy beams? No, no,
there's no chance of his escaping; the shutters are
covered with iron plates and strengthened with two
bars of iron, the door is nailed up outside with large
boat-nails three inches long. His coffin is more solid
than if it were made of oak and lead."</p>

<p>"I say, though, when La Louve comes out of prison,
and makes her way here, to see her man, as she calls
him?"</p>

<p>"Well, we shall say, 'Look for him.'"</p>

<p>"By the way, do you know that, if mother had not
shut up those young 'rips' of children, they would have
gnawed their ways through the door, like young rats, to
free Martial? That little vagabond François is quite
furious since he suspects we have packed away his
tall brother."</p>

<p>"But, you know, they mustn't be left in the room up-stairs
whilst we leave the island; the window is not
barred, and they have only to drop down outside."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment the attention of Nicholas and Calabash
was attracted by the sound of cries and sobs which
came from the house. They saw the door of the ground
floor, which had been open until then, close violently,
and a minute afterwards the pale and sinister countenance
of Mère Martial appeared through the bars of the
kitchen window. With her long lean arm the culprit's
widow made a sign to her children to come to her.</p>

<p>"There's a row, I know; I'll bet that it is François,
who's giving himself some airs again," said Nicholas.
"That beggar Martial! But for him, this young scamp
would be by himself. You keep a good look-out, and,
if you see the two women coming, give me a call."</p>

<p>Whilst Calabash again mounted the bench, and looked
out for the arrival of Séraphin and the Goualeuse,
Nicholas entered the house. Little Amandine was on
her knees in the centre of the kitchen, sobbing and
asking pardon for her Brother François. Enraged
and threatened, the lad, ensconced in one of the angles
of the apartment, had Nicholas's hatchet in his hand,
and appeared determined this time to offer the most
desperate resistance to his mother's wishes. Impassive
as usual, showing Nicholas the cellar, the widow made a
sign to her son to shut François up there.</p>

<p>"I will never be shut up there!" cried the boy, in a
determined tone. "You want to make us die of hunger,
like Brother Martial."</p>

<p>The widow looked at Nicholas with an impatient air,
as if to reproach him for not instantly executing her
commands, as, with another imperious gesture, she
pointed to François. Seeing his brother advance
towards him, the young boy brandished the axe with
a desperate air and cried:</p>

<p>"If you try to shut me up there, whether it is mother,
brother, or Calabash, so much the worse. I shall strike,
and the hatchet cuts."</p>

<p>Nicholas felt as the widow did the pressing necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
there was to prevent the two children from going to
Martial's succour whilst the house was left to itself, as
well as to put them out of the way of seeing the scenes
which were about to pass, for their window looked onto
the river in which they were about to drown Fleur-de-Marie.
But Nicholas was as cowardly as he was ferocious,
and, afraid of receiving a blow from the dangerous
hatchet with which his young brother was armed, hesitated
to approach him. The widow, angry at his
hesitation, pushed him towards François; but Nicholas,
again retreating, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But, mother, if he cuts me? You know I want all
my arms and fingers at this time, and I feel still the
thump that brute Martial gave me."</p>

<p>The widow shrugged her shoulders, and advanced
towards François.</p>

<p>"Don't come near me, mother," shrieked the boy in
a fury, "or you'll pay dear for all the beatings you have
given me and Amandine!"</p>

<p>"Let 'em shut us up; don't strike mother!" cried
Amandine, in fear.</p>

<p>At this moment Nicholas saw upon a chair a large
blanket which he used to wrap his booty in at times,
and, taking hold of and partly unfolding it, he threw it
completely over François's head, who, in spite of his
efforts, finding himself entangled under its folds, could
not make use of his weapon. Nicholas then seized hold
of him, and, with his mother's help, carried him into the
cellar. Amandine had continued kneeling in the centre
of the kitchen, and, as soon as she saw her brother overcome,
she sprang up and, in spite of her fright, went to
join him in the dark hole. The door was then double-locked
on the brother and sister.</p>

<p>"It will still be that infernal Martial's fault, if these
children behave in this outrageous manner to us," said
Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Nothing has been heard in his room since this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
morning," said the widow, with a pensive air, and she
shuddered, "nothing!"</p>

<p>"That's a sign, mother, that you were right to say to
Père Férot, the fisherman at Asnières, that Martial had
been so dangerously ill as to be confined to his bed for
the last two days; for now, when all is known, it will
not astonish anybody."</p>

<p>After a moment's silence, as and if she wished to
escape a painful thought, the widow replied, suddenly:</p>

<p>"Didn't the Chouette come here whilst I was at
Asnières?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"Why didn't she stay and accompany us to Bras-Rouge's?
I mistrust her."</p>

<p>"Bah! You mistrust everybody, mother; you are
always fancying they are going to play you some
trick. To-day it is the Chouette, yesterday it was
Bras-Rouge."</p>

<p>"Bras-Rouge is at liberty,&mdash;my son is at Toulon, yet
they committed the same robbery."</p>

<p>"You are always saying this. Bras-Rouge escaped
because he is as cunning as a fox&mdash;that's it; the
Chouette did not stay, because she had an appointment
at two o'clock, near the Observatory, with the
tall man in black, at whose desire she has carried off
this young country girl, by the help of the Schoolmaster
and Tortillard; and Barbillon drove the hackney-coach
which the tall man in black had hired for the job. So
how, mother, do you suppose the Chouette would inform
against us, when she tells us the 'jobs' she has in hand,
and we do not tell her ours? for she knows nothing of
this drowning job that is to come off directly. Be easy,
mother; wolves don't eat each other, and this will be
a good day's work; and when I recollect, too, that the
jewel-matcher has often about her twenty to thirty thousand
francs' worth of diamonds in her bag, and that, in
less than two hours, we shall have her in Bras-Rouge's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
cellar! Thirty thousand francs' worth of diamonds,
mother! Think of that!"</p>

<p>"And, whilst we lay hands on this woman, Bras-Rouge
is to remain outside the cabaret?" inquired
the widow, with an air of suspicion.</p>

<p>"Well, and where would you have him, I should like
to know? If any one comes to his house, mustn't he be
outside the door to answer them, and prevent them from
entering the place whilst we are doing our 'job?'"</p>

<p>"Nicholas! Nicholas!" cried Calabash, at this moment
from outside, "here come the two women!"</p>

<p>"Quick, quick, mother! Your shawl! I will land you
on the other side, and that will be so much done," said
Nicholas.</p>

<p>The widow had replaced her mourning head-dress with
a high black cap, in which she now made her appearance.
At the instigation of Nicholas, she wrapped herself in a
large plaid shawl, with gray and white checks; and, after
having carefully closed and secured the kitchen door, she
placed the key behind one of the window-shutters on the
ground-floor, and followed her son, who was hastily
pursuing his way to the landing-place. Almost involuntarily,
as she quitted the island, she cast a long and
meditative look at Martial's window; and the train of
thought to which its firmly nailed and iron-bound exterior
gave rise seemed, to judge by their effect, to be of a
very mingled and complicated character, for she knitted
her brows, pursed her lips, and then, after a sudden
convulsive shudder, she murmured, in a low hesitating
voice:</p>

<p>"It is his own fault&mdash;it is his own fault!"</p>

<p>"Nicholas, do you see them? Just down there, along
the path,&mdash;a country girl and an old woman!" exclaimed
Calabash, pointing to the other side of the river, where
Madame Séraphin and Fleur-de-Marie were descending a
narrow, winding path which passed by a high bank, on
the top of which were the lime-kilns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us wait for the signal; don't let us spoil the job
by too much haste," said Nicholas.</p>

<p>"What! Are you blind? Don't you recognise the stout
woman who came the day before yesterday? Look at
her orange shawl; and the little country girl, what a
hurry she seems in! She's a good little thing, I know;
and it's plain she has no idea of what is going to happen
to her, or she wouldn't hasten on at that pace, I'm
thinking."</p>

<p>"Yes, I recollect the stout woman now. It's all right,
then&mdash;all right! Although they are so much behind the
time I had almost given up the job as bad. But let us
quite understand the thing, Calabash. I shall take the
old woman and the young girl in the boat with a valve
to it; you will follow me close on, stern to stern; and
mind and row steadily, so that, with one spring, I may
jump from one boat to the other, as soon as I have
opened the pipe and the water begins to sink the boat."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid about me, it is not the first time I've
pulled a boat, is it?"</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of being drowned, you know I can
swim; but, if I did not jump well into the other boat,
why, the women, in their struggles against drowning,
might catch hold of me and&mdash;much obliged to you,
but I have no fancy for a bath with the two ladies."</p>

<p>"The old woman waves her handkerchief," said
Calabash; "there they are on the bank."</p>

<p>"Come, come along, mother, let's push off," said
Nicholas, unmooring. "Come you into the boat with
the valve, then the two women will not have any fear;
and you, Calabash, jump into t'other, and use your arms,
my girl, and pull a good one. Ah, by the way, take the
boat-hook and put it beside you, it is as sharp as a lance,
and it may be useful," added the ruffian, as he placed
beside Calabash in the boat a long hook with a sharp
iron point.</p>

<p>A few moments, and the two boats, one rowed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Nicholas and the other by Calabash, reached the shore
where, for some moments, Madame Séraphin and Fleur-de-Marie
had been waiting. Whilst Nicholas was fastening
his boat to a post on the bank, Madame Séraphin
approached him, and said, in a low and rapid tone:</p>

<p>"Say that Madame Georges is waiting for us at the
island,&mdash;you understand?" And then, in a louder
voice, she added, "We are rather late, my lad."</p>

<p>"Yes, my good lady, Madame Georges has been asking
for you several times."</p>

<p>"You see, my dear young lady, Madame Georges is
waiting for us," said Madame Séraphin, turning to
Fleur-de-Marie, who, in spite of her confidence, had
felt considerable repugnance at the sight of the
sinister countenances of Calabash, Nicholas, and the
widow; but the mention of Madame Georges reassured
her, and she replied:</p>

<p>"I am just as impatient to see Madame Georges;
fortunately, it is not a long way across."</p>

<p>"How delighted the dear lady will be!" said Madame
Séraphin. Then, addressing Nicholas, "Now, then, my
lad, bring your boat a little closer that we may get in."
Adding, in an undertone, "The girl must be drowned,
mind; if she comes up thrust her back again into the
water."</p>

<p>"All right, ma'am; and don't be alarmed yourself,
but, when I make you the signal, give me your hand,
she'll then pass under all alone, for everything's ready,
and you have nothing to fear," replied Nicholas, in a
similar tone; and then, with savage brutality, unmoved
by Fleur-de-Marie's youth and beauty, he put his hand
out to her. The young girl leaned lightly on him and
entered the boat.</p>

<p>"Now you, my good lady," said Nicholas to Madame
Séraphin, offering her his hand in turn.</p>

<p>Was it presentiment, or mistrust, or only fear that she
could not spring quickly enough out of the little bark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
in which Nicholas and the Goualeuse were, that made
Jacques Ferrand's housekeeper say to Nicholas, shrinking
back, "No, I'll go in the boat with mademoiselle?"
And she took her seat by Calabash.</p>

<p>"Just as you please," said Nicholas, exchanging an
expressive look with his sister as, with a vigorous
thrust with his oar, he drove his boat from the bank.</p>

<p>His sister did the same directly Madame Séraphin
was seated beside her. Standing, looking fixedly on
the bank, indifferent to the scene, the widow, pensive
and absorbed, fixed her look obstinately on Martial's
window, which was discernible from the landing-place
through the poplars. During this time the two boats,
in the first of which were Nicholas and Fleur-de-Marie
and in the other Calabash and Madame Séraphin, left
the bank slowly.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<h5>THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING.</h5>


<p>Before the reader is made acquainted with the
<i>dénouement</i> of the drama then passing in Nicholas's
boat, we shall beg leave to retrace our steps.</p>

<p>Shortly after Fleur-de-Marie had quitted St. Lazare
in company of Madame Séraphin, La Louve also left
that prison. Thanks to the recommendations of Madame
Armand and the governor, who were desirous of recompensing
her for her kindness towards Mont Saint-Jean,
the few remaining days the beloved of Martial had still
to remain in confinement were remitted her. A complete
change had come over this hitherto depraved,
degraded, and intractable being. Forever brooding over
the description of the peaceful, wild, and retired life,
so beautifully depictured by Fleur-de-Marie, La Louve
entertained the utmost horror and disgust of her past
life. To bury herself with Martial in the deep shades
of some vast forest, such was her waking and dreaming
thought,&mdash;the one fixed idea of her existence, against
which all her former evil inclinations had in vain struggled
when, separating herself from La Goualeuse, whose
growing influence she feared, this singular creature had
retired to another part of St. Lazare.</p>

<p>To complete this sincere though rapid conversion,
still more assured by the ineffectual resistance attempted
by the perverse and froward habits of her companion,
Fleur-de-Marie, following the dictates of her own natural
good sense, had thus reasoned:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"La Louve, a violent and determined creature, is
passionately fond of Martial. She would, then, hail
with delight the means of quitting the disgraceful life
she now, for the first time, views with shame and disgust,
for the purpose of entirely devoting herself to the
rude, unpolished man whose taste she so entirely partakes
of, and who seeks to hide himself from the world,
as much from inclination as from a desire of escaping
from the universal reprobation in which his family is
viewed."</p>

<p>Assisted by these small materials, gleaned during her
conversation with La Louve, Fleur-de-Marie, in giving a
right direction to the unbridled passion and restraining
the daring hardihood of the reckless creature, had positively
converted a lost, wretched being into an honest
woman; for what could the most virtuous of her sex
have desired more than to bestow her undivided affections
on the man of her choice, to dwell with him in
the silence and solitude of woods, where hard labour,
privations and poverty, would all be cheerfully borne
and shared for his dear sake, to whom her heart was
given?</p>

<p>And such was the constant, ardent prayer of La
Louve. Relying on the assistance which Fleur-de-Marie
had assured her of in the name of an unknown benefactor,
La Louve determined to make her praiseworthy
proposal to her lover, not, indeed, without the keen and
bitter apprehension of being rejected by him, for La
Goualeuse, while she brought her to blush for her past
life, awakened her to a just sense also of her position as
regarded Martial.</p>

<p>Once at liberty, La Louve thought only of seeing
"her man," as she called him. He took exclusive
possession of her mind; she had heard nothing of him
for several days. In the hopes of meeting with him in
the Isle du Ravageur, and with the determination of
waiting there until he came, should she fail to find him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
at first, she paid the driver of a cabriolet liberally to
conduct her with all speed to the bridge of Asnières,
which she crossed about a quarter of an hour before
Madame Séraphin and Fleur-de-Marie (they having
walked from the barrier) had reached the banks of the
river near the lime-kilns. As Martial did not present
himself to ferry La Louve across to the Isle du Ravageur,
she applied to an old fisherman, named Father Férot,
who lived close by the bridge.</p>

<p>It was about four o'clock in the day when a cabriolet
stopped at the entrance of a small street in the village
of Asnières. La Louve leaped from it at one bound,
threw a five-franc piece to the driver, and proceeded
with all haste to the dwelling of old Férot, the ferryman.
La Louve, no longer dressed in her prison garb,
wore a gown of dark green merino, a red imitation of
cashmere shawl with large, flaming pattern, and a net
cap trimmed with riband; her thick, curly hair was
scarcely smoothed out, her impatient longing to see
Martial having rendered an ordinary attention to her
toilet quite impossible. Any other female would, after
so long a separation, have exerted her very utmost
to appear becomingly adorned at her first interview
with her lover; but La Louve knew little and cared
less for all these coquettish arts, which ill accorded
with her excitable nature. Her first, her predominating
desire was to see "her man" as quickly as possible, and
this impetuous wish was caused, not alone by the fervour
of a love which, in minds as wild and unregulated as
hers, sometimes leads on to madness, but also from a
yearning to pour into the ear of Martial the virtuous
resolutions she had formed, and to reveal to him the
bright vista of happiness opened to both by her conversation
with Fleur-de-Marie.</p>

<p>The flying steps of La Louve soon conducted her
to the fisherman's cottage, and there, seated tranquilly
before the door, she found Father Férot, an old, white-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
man, busily employed mending his nets. Even
before she came close up to him, La Louve cried out:</p>

<p>"Quick, quick, Father Férot! Your boat! Your
boat!"</p>

<p>"What! Is it you, my girl? Well, how are you?
I have not seen you this long while."</p>

<p>"I know, I know; but where is your boat? and take
me across to the isle as fast as you can row."</p>

<p>"My boat? Well to be sure! Now, how very unlucky!
As if it was to be so. Bless you, my girl, it is quite out
of my power to ferry you across to-day."</p>

<p>"But why? Why is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, my son has taken my boat to go up
to the boat-races held at St. Ouen. Bless your heart, I
don't think there's a boat left all along the river's side."</p>

<p>"Distraction!" exclaimed La Louve, stamping her
foot and clenching her hand. "Then all is lost; I shall
not be able to see him!"</p>

<p>"'Pon my honour and word, it's true, though," said
old Férot. "I am extremely sorry I am unable to ferry
you over, because, no doubt, by your going on so, he is
very much worse."</p>

<p>"Who is much worse? Who?"</p>

<p>"Why, Martial!"</p>

<p>"Martial!" exclaimed La Louve, snatching the sleeve
of old Férot's jacket, "My man ill?"</p>

<p>"Bless me! Did you not know it?"</p>

<p>"Martial? Do you mean Martial?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I do; but don't hold me so tight, you'll
tear my blouse. Now be quiet, there's a good girl. I
declare you frighten me, you stare about so wildly."</p>

<p>"Ill! Martial ill? And how long has he been so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, two or three days."</p>

<p>"'Tis false! He would have written and told me of
it, had it been so."</p>

<p>"Ah, but then, don't you see? He's been too bad to
handle a pen."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Too ill to write! And he is on the isle! Are you
sure&mdash;quite sure he is there?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'll tell you. You must know, this morning,
I meets the widow Martial. Now you are aware, my
girl, that most, in general, when I notice her coming one
way, I make it my business to go the other, for I am not
particular fond of her,&mdash;I can't say I am. So then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But my man&mdash;my man! Tell me of him!"</p>

<p>"Wait a bit,&mdash;I'm coming to him. So when I found
I couldn't get away from the mother, and, to speak the
honest truth, that woman makes me afraid to seem to
slight her. She has a sort of an evil look about her,
like one as could do you any manner of harm for only
wishing for; I can't account for it, I don't know what
it is, for I am not timorous by nature, but somehow the
widow Martial does downright scare me. Well, says I,
thinking just to say a few words and pass on, 'I haven't
seen anything of your son Martial these last two or three
days,' says I, 'I suppose he's not with you just now?'
upon which she fixed her eyes upon me with such a look!
'Tis well they were not pistols, or they would have shot
me, as folks say."</p>

<p>"You drive me wild! And then&mdash;and what said
she?"</p>

<p>Father Férot was silent for a minute or two, and then
added:</p>

<p>"Come, now, you are a right sort of a girl; if you
will only promise me to be secret, I will tell you all I
know."</p>

<p>"Concerning my man?"</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure, for Martial is a good fellow, though
somewhat thoughtless; and it would be a sore pity
should any mischance befall him through that old
wretch of a mother or his rascally brother!"</p>

<p>"But what is going on? What have his mother or
brother done? And where is he, eh? Speak, I tell
you! Speak!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well, have a little patience! And, I say, do just
let my blouse alone! Come, take your hands off, there's
a good girl; if you keep interrupting me, and tear my
clothes in this way, I shall never be able to finish
my story, and you will know nothing at last."</p>

<p>"Oh, how you try my patience!" exclaimed La Louve,
stamping her foot with intense passion.</p>

<p>"And you promise never to repeat a word of what I
am about to tell you?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I never will!"</p>

<p>"Upon your word of honour?"</p>

<p>"Father Férot, you will drive me mad!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a hot-headed girl it is! Well, now, then,
this is what I have got to say; but, first and foremost, I
must tell you that Martial is more than ever at variance
with his family; and, if he were to get some foul play at
their hands, I should not be at all surprised; and that
makes me the more sorry my boat is not at hand to help
you across the water, for, if you reckon upon either
Nicholas or Calabash taking you over to the isle, why,
you'll just find yourself disappointed, that's all."</p>

<p>"I know that as well as you do; but what did my
man's mother tell you? He was in the isle, then, when
he fell ill, was he not?"</p>

<p>"Don't you put me out so with your questions; let
me tell my story my own way. This morning I says to
the widow,'Why,' says I,'I have seen nothing of Martial
these last two or three days. I mark his boat is
still moored,&mdash;he don't seem to use it as usual; I suppose
he's gone away a bit? Maybe he's in Paris upon
his business?' Upon which the widow gave me, oh,
such a devil's look! So says she,'He's bad a-bed in the
isle, and we don't look for him to get better!' 'Oh,
oh!' says I to myself,'that's it, is it? It's three days
since&mdash;' Holla! stop, I say!" cried old Férot, interrupting
himself; "where the deuce are you going?
What is the girl after now?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>Believing the life of Martial in danger from the
inhabitants of the isle, and unable longer to endure
the twaddle of the old fisherman, La Louve rushed, half
frantic with rage and fear, towards the banks of the
Seine. Some topographical descriptions will be requisite
for the perfect understanding of the ensuing scene.</p>

<p>The Isle du Ravageur was nearer to the left bank of
the river than it was to the right, from which Fleur-de-Marie
and Madame Séraphin had embarked. La Louve
stood on the left bank. Without being extremely high,
the surface of the isle completely prevented those on one
side the river from seeing what was passing on the opposite
bank; thus La Louve had been unable to witness
the embarkation of La Goualeuse, while the Martial
family had been equally prevented from seeing La
Louve, who, at that very instant, was rushing in wild
desperation along the banks of the other side of the
river.</p>

<p>Let us also recall to the reader, that the country-house
belonging to Doctor Griffon, and temporarily occupied by
the Count Saint-Remy was midway between the land
and that part of the shore where La Louve arrived half
wild with apprehension and impatience. Unconsciously
she rushed past two individuals, who, struck with
her excited manner and haggard looks, turned back to
watch her proceedings. These two personages were the
Count Saint-Remy and Doctor Griffon.</p>

<p>The first impulse of La Louve, upon learning the
danger which threatened her lover, was to hurry
towards the spot from whence the peril proceeded;
but, as she reached the water's edge, she became painfully
sensible of the difficulties that stood in the way of
her reaching the opposite land. As the old fisherman
had assured her, she well knew the folly of expecting
any strangers to pass by, and none of the Martial family
would take the trouble of rowing over to fetch her to
the isle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Heated and breathless, her eyes sparkling with eager
excitement, she stopped opposite that point of the isle
which, taking a sudden bend in this direction, was the
nearest approach from the shore. Through the leafless
branches of the willows and poplars, La Louve could see
the roof of the very house where Martial perhaps lay
dying.</p>

<p>At this distracting idea La Louve uttered a wild cry
of desperation, then, snatching off her shawl and cap,
she slipped out of her gown; and, undressed as she was
to her petticoat, she threw herself intrepidly into the
river, waded until she got out of her depth, and then,
fearlessly striking out, she swam determinedly towards
the isle, affording a strange spectacle of wild and desperate
energy. At each fresh impulsion of the arms
the long, thick hair of La Louve, unfastened by the violent
exercise she was using, shook and waved about her
head like the rich mane of a war-horse. But for the
fixedness of her gaze, constantly riveted on the house
which contained Martial, and the contraction of her features,
drawn together by almost the convulsive agonies of
fear and dreadful anticipation of arriving too late, the
poacher's mistress might have been supposed to have
been merely enjoying the cool refreshment of the water
for her own sport and diversion, so boldly and freely did
she swim.</p>

<p>Tattooed in remembrance of her lover, her white but
sinewy arms, strong as those of a man, divided the
waters with a stroke which sent the sparkling element
in rushing streams of liquid pearls over her broad shoulders
and strong, expansive chest, resembling a block of
half-submerged marble. All at once, from the other
side of the isle, rose a cry of distress,&mdash;a cry of agony
at once fearful and despairing. La Louve started, and
suddenly stopped in her rapid course; then supporting
herself with one hand, with the other she pushed back
her thick, dripping hair, and listened. Again the cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
was repeated, but more feebly, supplicatory, convulsive,
and expiring; and then the most profound silence reigned
around.</p>

<p>"'Tis Martial&mdash;'tis his cry! He calls me to his
aid!" exclaimed La Louve, swimming with renewed
vigour, for, in her excited state of mind, the voice which
had rent the air, and sent a pang through her whole
frame, seemed to her to be that of her lover.</p>

<p>The count and the doctor, whom La Louve had rushed
so quickly by, were quite unable to overtake her in time
to prevent her daring attempt; but both arrived immediately
opposite the isle at the moment when those
frightful cries were heard. Both stopped, as perfectly
shocked and startled as La Louve had been. Observing
the desperate energy with which she battled with the
water, they exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The unfortunate creature means to drown herself!"</p>

<p>But their fears were vain. Martial's mistress swam
like an otter, and, with a few more vigorous strokes, the
intrepid creature had reached the land. She gained her
feet, and, to assist her in climbing up the bank, she took
hold of one of the stakes used as a sort of protecting
stockade at the extremity of the isle, when at that instant,
as partially in the water and holding on by one
hand, she saw drifting along the form of a young female,
dressed after the fashion of the country girls who come
to Paris with their wares. The body floated slowly on
with the current, which drove it against the piles, while
the garments served to render it buoyant. To cling to
one of the strongest stakes, and with the hand left free
to snatch at the clothes of the female as it was passing,
was the instantaneous impulse of La Louve,&mdash;an impulse
executed as rapidly as conceived. In her extreme
eagerness, however, she drew the unfortunate being she
sought to save so suddenly and violently towards herself
and within the small enclosure formed by the piles, that
the body sunk completely under water, though here it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
was shallow enough to walk to land. Gifted with skill
and strength far from common, La Louve raised La
Goualeuse (for she it was, although not as yet recognised
by her late friend), took her up in her powerful arms as
though she had been a child, and laid her on the grassy
banks of the isle.</p>

<p>"Courage! Courage!" shouted M. de Saint-Remy,
from the opposite side, having, as well as Doctor Griffon,
witnessed this bold deliverance. "We will make
all haste to cross the bridge of Asnières, and bring a
boat to your assistance."</p>

<p>After thus speaking, both the count and his companion
proceeded as quickly as they were able in the
direction of the bridge; but La Louve heard not the
words addressed to her.</p>

<p>Let us again repeat, that, from the right bank of the
Seine, on which Nicholas, Calabash, and their mother
assembled after the commission of their atrocious crime,
it was impossible, owing to its steepness, to observe what
was passing on the opposite shore. Fleur-de-Marie,
abruptly drawn by La Louve within the piles, having
first sunk completely from the eyes of her murderers,
was thus in safety from any further pursuit on their
part, they believing that she had effectually perished.</p>

<p>A few instants after, the current, as it swept by, carried
with it a second body, floating near to the surface
of the water; but La Louve perceived it not. It was
the corpse of Madame Séraphin, the notary's <i>femme de
charge</i>. She, however, was perfectly dead.</p>

<p>It was as much the interest of Nicholas and Calabash
as it was of Jacques Ferrand to remove so formidable a
witness as well as sharer of their crime; seizing the
opportunity, therefore, when the boat sunk with Fleur-de-Marie,
to spring into that rowed by his sister, and in
which was Madame Séraphin, he contrived to give the
small vessel so great a shock as almost threw the <i>femme
de charge</i> into the water, and, while struggling to recover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
herself, he managed to thrust her overboard, and then
to finish her with his boat-hook.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Breathless and exhausted, La Louve, kneeling on the
grass beside Fleur-de-Marie, tried to recover her strength,
and, at the same time, to make out the features of her she
had saved from certain death. Who can describe her
surprise, her utter astonishment, as she recognised
her late prison companion,&mdash;she who had exercised so
beneficial an influence on her mind, and produced so complete
a change in her conduct and ideas? In the first
bewilderment of her feelings even Martial was forgotten.</p>

<p>"La Goualeuse!" exclaimed she, as, with head bent
down, her hair dishevelled, her garments streaming with
wet, she, kneeling, contemplated the unhappy girl
stretched almost dying before her on the grass.</p>

<p>Pale, motionless, her half closed eyes vacant and senseless,
her beautiful hair glued to her pallid brows, her lips
blue and livid, her small, delicate hands stiff and cold,
La Goualeuse might well have passed for dead to any but
the watchful eye of affection.</p>

<p>"La Goualeuse!" again cried La Louve. "What a
singular chance that I should have come hither to relate
to my man all the good and harm she has done me with
her words and promises, as well as the resolution I have
taken, and to find the poor thing thus to give me the
meeting! Poor girl! She is cold and dead. But, no,
no!" exclaimed La Louve, stooping still more closely
over Fleur-de-Marie, and, as she did so, finding a faint&mdash;indeed,
almost imperceptible&mdash;breath escape her lips;
"no, she lives! Merciful Father, she breathes! And
'tis I have snatched her from death! I, who never yet
saved any one! Oh, how happy the thought makes me!
My heart glows with a new delight. How thankful I
feel that none but I saved her! Ha! but my man,&mdash;I
must save him also. Perhaps he is even now in his
death-throes&mdash;his mother and brother are even wretches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
enough to murder him! What shall I do? I cannot
leave this poor creature here,&mdash;I will carry her to the
widow's house. She must and she shall succour the poor
Goualeuse and let me see Martial, or I will smash everything
in my way. No mother, brother, or sister shall
hinder me from going wherever my man is!"</p>

<p>And, springing up as she spoke, La Louve raised
Fleur-de-Marie in her strong arms. Charged with this
slender burthen, she hurried towards the house, never for
a moment doubting that, spite of their hard and wicked
natures, the widow and her daughter would bestow on
Fleur-de-Marie every requisite care.</p>

<p>When Martial's mistress had reached that point of the
isle from which both sides of the Seine were distinguishable,
Nicholas, his mother, and Calabash had quitted the
place, certain of the accomplishment of their double
crime; they then repaired, in all haste, to the house of
Bras-Rouge.</p>

<p>At this moment a man who, hidden in one of the recesses
of the river concealed by the lime-kiln, had, without
being seen himself, witnessed the whole progress of
this horrible scene, also disappeared; believing, as well
as the guilty perpetrators, that the fell deed had been
fully achieved. This man was Jacques Ferrand.</p>

<p>One of Nicholas's boats was rocking to and fro, moored
to a stake on the river's bank, just by where Madame
Séraphin and La Goualeuse had embarked.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Jacques Ferrand quitted the lime-kiln to
return to Paris than M. de Saint-Remy and Doctor Griffon
hastily crossed the bridge of Asnières, for the purpose of
reaching the isle; which they contemplated doing by
means of Nicholas's boat, which they had discerned from
afar.</p>

<p>To the extreme astonishment of La Louve, when she
arrived at the house in the Isle du Ravageur, she found
the door shut and fastened. Placing the still inanimate
form of Fleur-de-Marie beneath the porch, she more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
closely examined the dwelling. The window of Martial's
chamber was well known to her; what was her surprise
to find the shutters belonging to it closed, and sheets of
tin nailed over them, strongly secured from without by
two bars of iron!</p>

<p>Suspecting a part of the cause of this, La Louve, in a
loud, hoarse voice of mingled fury and deep tenderness,
screamed out as loudly as she could:</p>

<p>"Martial! My man!"</p>

<p>No answer was returned.</p>

<p>Terrified at this silence, La Louve began pacing round
and round the house like a wild beast who scents the
spot whither her mate has been entrapped, and with deep
roars and savage growls demands admittance to him.</p>

<p>Still pursuing her agitated search, La Louve kept
shouting from time to time, "My man! Are you there,
my man?" And in her desperate fury she shook and
rattled the bars of the kitchen windows, beat against
the walls, and knocked long and loudly at the door. All
at once a dull, indistinct noise was heard from withinside
the house. Eagerly and attentively La Louve
listened; the noise, however, ceased.</p>

<p>"My man heard me! I must and will get in somehow,
if I gnaw the door away with my teeth."</p>

<p>And again she reiterated her frantic cries and adjurations
to Martial. Several faint blows struck inside the
closed shutters of Martial's chamber replied to the yells
and screams of La Louve.</p>

<p>"He is there!" cried she, suddenly stopping beneath
the window of her lover. "He is there! I am sure of
it; and if all other means fail I will strip off that tin
with my nails, but I will wrench those shutters open!"</p>

<p>So saying, she glanced frantically around in search of
something to aid her efforts to free her lover, when her
eye caught sight of a ladder partly hanging against one
of the outside shutters of the sitting-room. Hastily pulling
the shutter, the more quickly to disengage the ladder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
the key of the outer door, left by the widow on the sill
of the window, fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh, if this be only the right key!" cried La Louve,
trying it in the lock of the entrance door; "I can go
straight up stairs to his chamber. Oh, it turns! It
opens!" exclaimed La Louve, with delight; "and my
man is saved!"</p>

<p>Once in the kitchen she was struck by the cries of the
two children, who, shut up in the cellar, and hearing an
unusual noise, called loudly for help. The widow, persuaded
that no person would visit the isle or her dwelling,
had contented herself with double-locking the door
upon François and Amandine, leaving the key in the
lock.</p>

<p>Released by La Louve, the two children hurried from
the cellar to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Oh, La Louve!" exclaimed François, "save our dear
Brother Martial; they want him to die! For two days
he has been shut up in his room!"</p>

<p>"They have not wounded him, have they?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I think not!"</p>

<p>"I have arrived just in time, it seems," cried La
Louve, rushing towards the staircase, and hastily mounting
the stairs. Then, suddenly stopping, she exclaimed,
"Ah, but La Goualeuse! I quite forgot her. Amandine,
my child, light a fire directly; and then do you and your
brother fetch a poor, half-drowned girl you will find lying
outside the door under the porch, and place her before
the fire. She would have been quite dead, if I had not
saved her. François, quick! Bring me a crowbar, a
hatchet, an axe, anything, that I may break in the door
that confines my man!"</p>

<p>"There is the cleaver we split wood with, but it is too
heavy for you," said the lad, dragging forward an enormous
chopper.</p>

<p>"Too heavy! I don't even feel it!" cried La Louve,
swinging the ponderous weapon, which, at another time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
she would have had much difficulty in lifting, as though
it had been a feather.</p>

<p>Then, proceeding with hurried steps up-stairs, she
called out to the children:</p>

<p>"Go and fetch the young girl I told you of, and place
her by the fire."</p>

<p>And, with two bounds, La Louve reached the corridor,
at the end of which was situated the apartment of
Martial.</p>

<p>"Courage! Courage, my man! Your Louve is here!"
cried she, and, lifting the cleaver with both hands, she
dashed it furiously against the door.</p>

<p>"It is fastened on the outside," moaned Martial, in a
feeble voice; "draw out the nails,&mdash;you cannot open it
otherwise."</p>

<p>Throwing herself upon her knees in the passage, by
the help of the edge of the cleaver, her nails, which she
almost tore bleeding from their roots, and her fingers,
which were lacerated and torn, La Louve contrived to
extract the huge nails which fastened the door all around.
At length her heroic exertions were crowned with success,&mdash;the
door yielded to her efforts, and Martial, pale,
bleeding, and almost exhausted, fell into the arms of his
mistress.</p>

<p>"At last&mdash;I have you&mdash;I hold you&mdash;I press you to
my heart!" exclaimed La Louve, as she received and
tenderly pressed Martial in her arms, with a joy of
possession that partook almost of savage energy. She
supported, or, rather, carried him to a bench placed in
the corridor. For several minutes Martial remained
weak and haggard, endeavouring to recover from the
violent surprise which had proved nearly too much for
his exhausted strength. La Louve had come to the succour
of her lover at the very instant when, worn-out and
despairing, he felt himself dying,&mdash;less from want of
food than air, which it was impossible to obtain in so
small an apartment, unprovided with a chimney or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
other outlet, and hermetically closed, thanks to the
fiendish contrivance of Calabash, who had stopped even
the most trifling crevices in the door and window with
pieces of old rag.</p>

<p>Trembling with joy and apprehension, her eyes streaming
with tears, La Louve, kneeling beside Martial, watched
his slightest movements, and intently gazed on his features.
The unfortunate youth seemed gradually to
recover as his lungs inhaled a freer and more healthful
atmosphere. After a few convulsive shudderings he
raised his languid head, heaved a deep sigh, and, opening
his eyes, looked eagerly around him.</p>

<p>"Martial! 'Tis I!&mdash;your Louve! How are you
now?"</p>

<p>"Better!" replied he, in a feeble voice.</p>

<p>"Thank God! Will you have a little water or some
vinegar?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Martial, speaking more naturally;
"air, air! Oh, I want only air!"</p>

<p>At the risk of gashing the backs of her hands, La
Louve drove them through the four panes of a window
she could not have opened without first removing a
large and heavy table.</p>

<p>"Now I breathe! I breathe freely! And my head
seems quite relieved!" said Martial, entirely recovering
his senses and voice.</p>

<p>Then, as if recalling for the first time the service his
mistress had rendered him, he exclaimed, with a burst of
ineffable gratitude:</p>

<p>"But for you, my brave Louve, I should soon have
been dead!"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind thinking of that! But tell me, how
do you find yourself now?"</p>

<p>"Better&mdash;much better!"</p>

<p>"You are hungry, I doubt not?"</p>

<p>"No; I feel myself too weak for that. What I have
suffered most cruelly from has been want of air. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
last I felt suffocating, strangling, choking. Oh, it was
dreadful!"</p>

<p>"But now?"</p>

<p>"I live again. I come forth from the very tomb
itself; and that, too, thanks to you!"</p>

<p>"And these cuts upon your poor bleeding hands!
For God's sake, what have they done to you?"</p>

<p>"Nicholas and Calabash, not daring to attack me
openly a second time, fastened me up in my chamber
to allow me to perish of hunger in it. I tried to prevent
their nailing up my shutters, and my sister chopped
my fingers with a hatchet."</p>

<p>"The monsters! They wished to make it appear that
you had died of sickness. Your mother had spread the
report of your being in a hopeless state. Your mother,
my man,&mdash;your own mother!"</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried Martial, with bitterness; "mention
her not." Then for the first time remarking the wet
garments and singular state of La Louve's attire, he
added, "But what has happened to you? Your hair is
dripping wet; you have only your underclothes on; and
they are drenched through."</p>

<p>"No matter, no matter what has happened to me,
since you are saved. Oh, yes,&mdash;saved!"</p>

<p>"But explain to me how you became thus wet
through."</p>

<p>"I knew you were in danger, and finding no boat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You swam to my rescue?"</p>

<p>"I did. But your hands? Give them to me that I
may heal them with my kisses! You are in pain, I fear?
Oh, the monsters! And I not here to help you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my brave Louve!" exclaimed Martial, enthusiastically;
"bravest and best of all brave creatures!"</p>

<p>"Did not your hand trace on my arm 'Death to the
cowardly?' See!" cried La Louve, showing her tattooed
arm, on which these very words were indelibly
engraved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you are bold and intrepid; but the cold has
seized you,&mdash;you tremble!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is not with cold."</p>

<p>"Never mind,&mdash;go in there. You will find Calabash's
cloak; wrap yourself well in it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I insist!"</p>

<p>In an instant La Louve, who had quickly flown at
her lover's second command, returned wrapped in a
plaid mantle.</p>

<p>"To think you ran the risk of drowning yourself,&mdash;and
all for me!" resumed Martial, gazing on her with
enthusiastic delight.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not altogether for you. A poor girl was
nearly perishing in the river, and I saved her as I
landed."</p>

<p>"Saved her also. And where is she?"</p>

<p>"Below with the children, who are taking care of her."</p>

<p>"And who is she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, you can scarcely credit what a singular
and lucky chance brought me to her rescue! She was
one of my companions at St. Lazare,&mdash;a most extraordinary
sort of girl. Oh, you don't half know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Only conceive my both hating and loving her;
for she had introduced happiness and death into my
heart and thoughts."</p>

<p>"Who? This girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and all on your account."</p>

<p>"On mine?"</p>

<p>"Hark ye, Martial!" Then interrupting her proposed
speech, La Louve continued, "No, no; I never,
never can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I had a request to make to you, and for that purpose
I came hither; because when I quitted Paris I
knew nothing of your danger."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then speak,&mdash;pray do!"</p>

<p>"I dare not."</p>

<p>"Dare not,&mdash;after all you have done for me?"</p>

<p>"No; for then it would appear as though I claimed
a right to be rewarded."</p>

<p>"A right to be rewarded? And have you not already
earned that right? Do I not already owe you much?
And did you not tend my sick bed with unfailing watchfulness,
both night and day during my illness of the
past year?"</p>

<p>"Are you not 'my man,&mdash;my own dear man?'"</p>

<p>"And for the reason that I am and ever shall be
'your man,' are you not bound to speak openly and
candidly to me?"</p>

<p>"For ever, Martial?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for ever; as true as my name is Martial. I
shall never care for any other woman in the world but
you, my brave Louve. Never mind what you may have
been, or what you may have done; that is nobody's
affair but mine. I love you, and you love me; and,
moreover, I owe you my life. But somehow, do you
know, since you have been in prison I have not been like
the same person. All sorts of fresh thoughts have come
into my mind. I have thought it well over, and I have
resolved that you shall no more be what you have been."</p>

<p>"What can you mean?"</p>

<p>"That I will never more quit you; neither will I part
from François and Amandine."</p>

<p>"Your young sister and brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes; from this day forward I must be as a second
father to these poor children. Don't you see, by imposing
on myself fresh duties, I am compelled to alter and
amend what is amiss in my way of conducting myself?
But I consider it my positive task to take charge of
these young things, or they will be made artful thieves.
And the only way to save them is to take them from
here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>"That I know not; but certainly far from Paris."</p>

<p>"And me?"</p>

<p>"You? Why, of course, you go with me!"</p>

<p>"With you?" exclaimed La Louve, with joyful surprise,&mdash;she
could not credit the reality of such happiness.
"And shall I never again be parted from
you?"</p>

<p>"No, my brave girl&mdash;never! You will help me to
bring up my little sister and young brother. I know your
heart. When I say to you, 'I greatly wish my poor
little Amandine to grow up a virtuous and industrious
woman. Just talk to her about it, and show her what
to do,' I am quite sure and certain that you will be to
her all the best mother could be to her own child."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, Martial,&mdash;thanks, thanks!"</p>

<p>"We shall live like honest workpeople. Never fear
but we shall find work; for we will toil like slaves to
content our employers; but, at least, these children will
not be depraved and degraded beings like their parents.
I shall not continually hear myself taunted with my
father and brother's disgraceful end, neither shall I go
through streets where you are known. But what is the
matter,&mdash;what ails you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Martial, I feel as though I should go mad."</p>

<p>"Mad!&mdash;for what?"</p>

<p>"For joy."</p>

<p>"And why should you go mad with joy?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because,&mdash;it is too much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mean that what you propose is too great happiness
for one like me to hope for. Oh, indeed, indeed, it is
more than I can bear! But who knows? Perhaps saving
La Goualeuse has brought me good luck,&mdash;that's
it, I am sure and certain."</p>

<p>"Still, I ask you, what is the matter, and why are you
thus agitated?" exclaimed Martial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Martial, Martial, the very thing you have been
proposing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I was going to ask you."</p>

<p>"To quit Paris?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied she, in a hurried tone; "and to try
your consent to accompany you to the forests, where we
should have a nice, neat little house, and children whom
I should love as La Louve would the children of her man&mdash;or,
if you would permit me," continued La Louve, in a
faltering voice, "instead of calling you 'my man,' to say
'my husband?' For," added she, confusedly and rapidly,
"for without that change, we should not obtain the place."</p>

<p>Martial, in his turn, regarded La Louve with deep
astonishment, unable to comprehend her meaning.</p>

<p>"What place are you speaking of?" said he, at
length.</p>

<p>"Of that of gamekeeper."</p>

<p>"That I should have?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And who would give it to me?"</p>

<p>"The protector of the young girl I saved."</p>

<p>"They do not know me."</p>

<p>"But I have told her all about you, and she will
recommend us to her protector."</p>

<p>"And what have you told her about me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Martial, can you not guess? Of what could I
speak but of your goodness&mdash;and my love for you?"</p>

<p>"My excellent Louve!"</p>

<p>"And then, you know, being in prison together makes
folks talk to each other, and open their hearts in the
way of confidence. Besides which, there was something
so gentle and engaging about this young creature, that I
could not help feeling drawn towards her, even in spite
of myself; for I very quickly discovered she was a very
different person to such as you and I have been used to."</p>

<p>"And who is she?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know not, neither can I guess; but certainly I
never met with any one like her. Bless you, she can
read the very thoughts of your heart, the same as if she
were a fairy. I merely told her of my love for you, and
she immediately interested herself in us. She made me
feel ashamed of my past life; not by saying harsh and
severe things,&mdash;you know very well that would not
have done much good with me,&mdash;but by talking of
the pleasures of a life passed in hard but peaceful
labour, tranquilly within the quiet shades of deep
forests, where you might be occupied according to your
tastes and inclinations; only, instead of your being a
poacher, she made you a gamekeeper, and in place of
my being only your mistress, she pictured me as your
true and lawful wife. And then we were to have fine,
healthy children who ran joyfully to meet you when you
returned at night, followed by your faithful dogs, and
carrying your gun on your shoulder. Then we all sat
down so gay and happy, to eat our supper beneath the
cool shade of the large trees that overhung our cottage
door, while the fresh wind blew, and the moon peeped at
us from amongst the thick branches, and the little ones
prattled and you related to us all you had seen and done
during the day, while wandering in the forests; until,
at last, cheerful and contented, we retired to rest, to rise
the following day, and with light hearts to recommence
our labours. I cannot tell you how it was, but I listened
and listened to these delightful pictures till I quite believed
in their reality. I seemed bound by a spell when
she spoke of happiness like this, though I tried ever so
much against it. I always found it impossible to disbelieve
that it would surely come to pass. Oh, but you
have no idea how beautifully she described it all! I
fancied I saw it&mdash;you&mdash;our children&mdash;our forest
home. I rubbed my eyes, but it was ever before them,
although a waking dream."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" said Martial, sighing; "that would, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
be a sweet and pleasant life! Without being
bad at heart, poor François has been quite enough in the
society of Calabash and Nicholas to make it far better
he should dwell in the solitude of woods and forests,
rather than be exposed to the further contamination of
great towns. Amandine would help you in your household
duties, and I should make a capital gamekeeper,
from the very fact of my having been a poacher of some
notoriety. I should have you for my housekeeper and
companion, my good Louve; and then, as you know, we
should have our children also. Bless their little hearts,
I doubt not our having a fine flock about us! And what
more could we wish for or desire? When once we got
used to a forest life, it would seem as though we had
always lived there; and fifty or a hundred years would
glide away like a single day. But you must not talk to
me of such happiness; it makes one so full of sadness
and regrets that it cannot be realised. No, no, don't let
us ever mention it again; because, don't you see, La
Louve, it comes over one like&mdash;I should soon work
myself up to madness if I allowed my thoughts to dwell
on it."</p>

<p>"Ah, Martial, I let you go on because I thought I was
quite as bad myself. I said just those very words to La
Goualeuse."</p>

<p>"Did you, really?"</p>

<p>"I did, indeed. For, after listening to all these tales
of enchantment, I said to her, 'What a pity, La Goualeuse,
that these castles in the air, as you call them, are
not true!' And what do you think, Martial," asked La
Louve, her eyes flashing with joy, "what do you think
she answered me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"'Why,' said she, 'only let Martial marry you, and
give me your promise to live honestly and virtuously
henceforward, and directly I quit the prison I will exert
myself to get the place I have been speaking of for him.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get me a gamekeeper's place?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I declare to you, Martial, she said so."</p>

<p>"Oh, but as you say, that can be but a dream&mdash;a
mere fancy. If, indeed, nothing were requisite for our
obtaining the place but our being married, my good girl,
that should be done to-morrow, if I had the means;
though, from this very day and hour, I consider you as
my true and lawful wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, Martial! I your lawful wife?"</p>

<p>"The only woman who shall ever bear that title.
And, for the future, I wish you to call me 'husband;'
for such I am in word and heart, as firmly and lastingly
as though we had been before the <i>maire</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, La Goualeuse was right. A woman feels so
proud and happy to say 'My husband!' Oh, Martial,
you shall see what a good, faithful, devoted wife I will
be to you; how hard I will work! Oh, I shall be so
delighted to labour for you!"</p>

<p>"And do you really think there is any chance of our
getting this place?"</p>

<p>"If the poor dear Goualeuse deceives herself about it,
it is that others deceive her; for she seemed quite sure
of being able to fulfil her promises. And besides, when
I was quitting the prison a little while ago, the inspectress
told me that the protectors of La Goualeuse, who
were people of rank and consequence, had removed her
from confinement that very day. Now that proved
her having powerful friends; so that she can keep her
word to us if she likes."</p>

<p>"But," cried Martial, suddenly rising, "I don't know
what we have been thinking of all this time!"</p>

<p>"Thinking about&mdash;what do you mean, Martial?"</p>

<p>"Why, the poor girl you saved from drowning is
down-stairs&mdash;perhaps dying; and, instead of rendering
her any assistance, we are attending to our own affairs
up-stairs."</p>

<p>"Make yourself perfectly easy; François and Amandine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
are there watching her, and they would have come
to call us had there been any danger or necessity.
Still you are right; let us go to her. You must see her
to whom we shall, perhaps, owe all our future happiness."</p>

<p>And Martial, supported by La Louve, descended to the
lower part of the house. Before they have reached
the kitchen, let us in a few words describe what had
occurred there from the time when Fleur-de-Marie had
been confided to the charge of the two children.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<h5>DOCTOR GRIFFON.</h5>


<p>François and Amandine had contrived to convey
Fleur-de-Marie near the fire, when M. de Saint-Remy
and Doctor Griffon, who had crossed the river in
Nicholas's boat, entered the house. Whilst the children
were making the fire burn up, Doctor Griffon
bestowed on the young girl his utmost care.</p>

<p>"The poor girl cannot be more than seventeen at
most!" exclaimed the count, who was looking on.
"What do you think of her, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Her pulse is scarcely perceptible; but, strange to
say, the skin of the face is not livid in the subject, as is
usually the case in asphyxia from submersion," replied
the doctor, with professional calmness, and contemplating
Fleur-de-Marie with a deeply meditative air.</p>

<p>Doctor Griffon was a tall, thin man, pallid and completely
bald, except two tufts of thin black hair, carefully
brushed back on the poll, and flattened on the temples.
His countenance, wrinkled and furrowed by the fatigues
of study, was calm, intelligent, and reflective. Profoundly
learned, of great experience, and a skilful
practitioner, first surgeon at a civil hospital, where
we shall again encounter him, Doctor Griffon had but
one defect, that of completely abstracting himself from
the patient, and only considering the disease. Young or
old, rich or poor, was no matter,&mdash;he only thought of
medical fact, more or less remarkable, which the subject
presented. For him there was nothing but subjects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a lovely face! How beautiful she is in spite
of this frightful paleness!" said M. de Saint-Remy.
"Did you ever see milder or more expressive features,
my dear doctor? And so young&mdash;so young!"</p>

<p>"Age is no consequence," said the doctor, abruptly,
"no more than the presence of water in the lungs,
which was formerly thought fatal. It was a gross
error, which the admirable experiments of Goodwin&mdash;the
famous Goodwin&mdash;incontestably detected and
exposed."</p>

<p>"But doctor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it is a fact," replied M. Griffon, absorbed by the
love of his art. "To detect the presence of any foreign
liquid in the lungs, Goodwin plunged some cats and dogs
several times into tubs filled with ink for some seconds,
taking them out alive, and then, after a time, dissected
the animals. Well, he was convinced from the dissection
that the ink had penetrated the lungs, and
that the presence of this liquid in the respiratory
organs had not caused the death of the subject."</p>

<p>The count knew the doctor was a worthy creature at
heart, but that his mad passion for science made him
often appear harsh and cruel.</p>

<p>"Have you any hope?" inquired M. de Saint-Remy,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"The extremities of the subject are very cold," said
the doctor; "there is but very slight hope."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor child! To die at that age is indeed
terrible!"</p>

<p>"Pupil fixed&mdash;dilated!" observed the doctor, impassive,
and pushing up the frigid eyelid of Fleur-de-Marie
with his forefinger.</p>

<p>"What a singular man!" exclaimed the comte, almost
with indignation. "One would suppose you pitiless, and
yet I have seen you watch by my bedside for nights
together. Had I been your brother, you could not have
been more generously devoted to me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>Doctor Griffon, still occupied in doing all that was
requisite and possible for Fleur-de-Marie, replied to the
comte without looking at him, and with imperturbable
phlegm:</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> Do you think one meets with an intermittent
fever so wonderfully complicated as that you
had! It was wonderful, my dear friend&mdash;astonishing!
Stupor, delirium, muscular action of the tendons, syncopes,&mdash;that
important fever combined the most varied
symptoms. You were, indeed, affected by a partial and
momentary attack of paralysis; and, if it had presented
nothing else, why, your attack was entitled to all the
attention in my power. You presented a magnificent
study; and, truth to say, my dear friend, what I desire
most in the world is to meet with such another glorious
fever. But that is a piece of good fortune that never
occurs twice!"</p>

<p>At this moment Martial descended, leaning on the
arm of La Louve, who still retained over her wet clothes
the plaid cloak which belonged to Calabash. Struck
with the paleness of Martial, and remarking his hands
covered with dried blood, the comte exclaimed, "Who is
this man?"</p>

<p>"My husband!" replied La Louve, looking at Martial
with an expression of happiness and noble pride impossible
to describe.</p>

<p>"You have a good and intrepid wife, sir," said the
comte to him. "I saw her save this unfortunate young
girl with singular courage."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, my wife is good and intrepid," replied
Martial, with emphasis, and regarding La Louve with an
air at once full of love and tenderness. "Yes, intrepid;
for she has also come in time to save my life."</p>

<p>"Your life?" exclaimed the comte.</p>

<p>"Look at his hands&mdash;his poor hands!" said La
Louve, wiping away the tears which softened the wild
brightness of her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Horrible!" cried the comte. "See, doctor, how his
hands are hacked!"</p>

<p>Doctor Griffon, turning his head slightly, and looking
over his shoulder at Martial's hands, said to him, "Open
and shut your hand."</p>

<p>Martial did so with considerable pain. The doctor
shrugged his shoulders, and continued his attentions
to Fleur-de-Marie, saying merely, and as if with
regret:</p>

<p>"There's nothing serious in those cuts,&mdash;there's no
tendon injured. In a week the subject will be able to
use his hands again."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, my husband will not be crippled?" said
La Louve, with gratitude.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head affirmatively.</p>

<p>"And La Goualeuse will recover&mdash;won't she, sir?"
inquired La Louve. "Oh, she must live, for I and my
husband owe her so much!" Then turning towards
Martial, "Poor dear girl! There she is, as I told you,&mdash;she
who will, perhaps, be the cause of our happiness;
for it was she who gave me the idea of coming and saying
to you all I have said. What a chance that I should
save her&mdash;and here, too!"</p>

<p>"She is a providence," said Martial, struck by the
beauty of La Goualeuse. "What an angel's face! Oh,
she will recover, will she not, doctor?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say," replied the doctor. "But, in the first
place, can she remain here? Will she have all necessary
attention?"</p>

<p>"Here?" cried La Louve; "why, they commit
murder here!"</p>

<p>"Silence&mdash;silence!" said Martial.</p>

<p>The comte and the doctor looked at La Louve with
surprise.</p>

<p>"This house in the isle has a bad reputation hereabouts,
and I am not astonished at it," observed the
doctor, in a low tone, to M. de Saint-Remy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have, then, been the victim of some violence?"
observed the comte to Martial. "How did you come by
those wounds?"</p>

<p>"They are nothing&mdash;nothing, sir. I had a quarrel&mdash;a
struggle ensued, and I was wounded. But this
young peasant girl cannot remain in this house," he
added, with a gloomy air. "I cannot remain here myself&mdash;nor
my wife, nor my brother, nor my sister, whom
you see. We are going to leave the isle, never to return
to it."</p>

<p>"Oh, how nice!" exclaimed the two children.</p>

<p>"Then what are we to do?" said the doctor, looking
at Fleur-de-Marie. "It is impossible to think of conveying
the subject to Paris in her present state of
prostration. But then my house is quite close at hand,
my gardener's wife and her daughter are capital nurses;
and since this asphyxia by submersion interests you,
my dear Saint-Remy, why, you can watch over the
necessary attentions, and I will come and see her every
day."</p>

<p>"And you assume the harsh and pitiless man,"
exclaimed the comte, "when, as your proposal proves,
you have one of the noblest hearts in the world!"</p>

<p>"If the subject sinks under it, as is possible, there
will be an opportunity for a most interesting dissection,
which will allow me to confirm once again Goodwin's
assertions."</p>

<p>"How horridly you talk!" cried the comte.</p>

<p>"For those who know how to read, the dead body is
a book in which they learn to save the lives of the
diseased!" replied Dr. Griffon, stoically.</p>

<p>"At last, then, you do good?" said M. de Saint-Remy,
with bitterness; "and that is important. What
consequence is the cause provided that benefit results?
Poor child! The more I look at her the more she
interests me."</p>

<p>"And well does she deserve it, I can tell you, sir,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
observed La Louve, with excitement, and approaching
him.</p>

<p>"Do you know her?" inquired the comte.</p>

<p>"Do I know her, sir? Why, it is to her I owe the
happiness of my life; and I have not done for her half
what she has done for me." And La Louve looked
passionately towards her husband,&mdash;she no longer called
him her man!</p>

<p>"And who is she?" asked M. de Saint-Remy.</p>

<p>"An angel, sir,&mdash;all that is good in this world.
Yes; and although she is dressed as a country girl,
there is no merchant's wife, no great lady, who can discourse
as well as she can, with her sweet little voice
just like music. She is a noble girl, I say,&mdash;full of
courage and goodness."</p>

<p>"By what accident did she fall into the water?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, sir."</p>

<p>"Then she is not a peasant girl?" asked the comte.</p>

<p>"A peasant girl,&mdash;look at her small white hands,
sir!"</p>

<p>"True," observed M. de Saint-Remy; "what a strange
mystery! But her name&mdash;her family?"</p>

<p>"Come along," said the doctor, breaking into the
conversation; "we must convey the subject into the
boat."</p>

<p>Half an hour after this, Fleur-de-Marie, who had not
yet recovered her senses, was in the doctor's abode,
lying in a good bed, and maternally watched by M.
Griffon's gardener's wife, to whom was added La Louve.
The doctor promised M. de Saint-Remy, who was more
and more interested in La Goualeuse, to return to see
her again in the evening. Martial went to Paris with
François and Amandine, La Louve being unwilling to
quit Fleur-de-Marie before she had been pronounced out
of danger.</p>

<p>The Isle du Ravageur remained deserted. We shall
presently find its sinister inhabitants at Bras-Rouge's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
where they were to be joined by the Chouette for the
murder of the diamond-matcher. In the meantime we
will conduct the reader to the rendezvous which Tom,
Sarah's brother, had with the horrible hag, the Schoolmaster's
accomplice.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<h5>THE PORTRAIT.</h5>


<p>Thomas Seyton, the brother of the Countess Sarah
Macgregor, was walking impatiently on the boulevards
near the Observatory, when he saw the Chouette arrive.
The horrible beldame had on a white cap and her usual
plaid shawl. The point of a stiletto, as round as a thick
swan's quill, and very sharp, having perforated a hole
at the bottom of her large straw basket which she carried
on her arm, the extremity of this murderous weapon,
which had belonged to the Schoolmaster, might be seen
projecting. Thomas Seyton did not perceive that the
Chouette was armed.</p>

<p>"It has just struck three by the Luxembourg," said the
old woman. "Here I am, like the hand of the clock."</p>

<p>"Come," replied Thomas Seyton. And, preceding
her, he crossed some open fields; and turning down a
deserted alley near the Rue Cassini, he stopped half way
down the lane, which was barred by a turnstile, opened
a small door, motioned to the Chouette to follow him;
and, after having advanced with her a few steps down
a path overgrown by thick trees, he said, "Wait here,"
and disappeared.</p>

<p>"That is, if you don't keep me on the 'waiting lay'
too long," responded the Chouette; "for I must be at
Bras Rouge's at five o'clock to meet the Martials, and
help silence the diamond-matcher. It's very well I have
my 'gulley' (poniard). Oh, the vagabond, he has got
his nose out of window!" added the hag, as she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the point of the stiletto coming through the seam in the
basket. And taking the weapon, which had a wooden
handle, from the basket, she replaced it so that it was
completely concealed. "This is <i>fourline's</i> tool," she
continued, "and he has asked me for it so many times
to kill the rats who came skipping about him in his
cellar. Poor things! They have no one but the old
blind man to divert them and keep them company.
They ought not to be hurt if they play about a bit; and
so I will not let him hurt the dears, and I keep his tool
to myself. Besides, I shall soon want it for this woman,
perhaps. Thirty thousand francs' worth of diamonds,&mdash;what
a 'haul' for each of us! It'll be a good day's
work, and not like that of the other day with that old
notary whom I thought to squeeze. It was no use to
threaten him if he would not 'stand some blunt' that I
would lay information that it was his housekeeper who
had sent La Goualeuse to me by Tournemine when she
was a little brat. Nothing frightened the old brute, he
called me an old hag, and shoved me out-of-doors.
Well, well, I'll send an anonymous letter to these people
at the farm where Pegriotte was, to inform them
that it was the notary who formerly abandoned her to
me. Perhaps they know her family; and when she gets
out of St. Lazare, why, the matter will get too hot for
that old brute, Jacques Ferrand. Some one comes,&mdash;ah,
it is the pale lady who was dressed in men's clothes at
the <i>tapis-franc</i> of the ogress, and with the tall fellow
who just left me, the same that the <i>fourline</i> and I robbed
by the excavations near Notre-Dame," added the Chouette,
as she saw Sarah appear at the extremity of the
walk. "Here's another job for me, I see; and this
little lady must have something to do with our having
carried off La Goualeuse from the farm. If she pays
well for another job of work, why, that will be 'the
ticket.'"</p>

<p>As Sarah approached the Chouette, whom she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
again for the first time since their rencontre at the <i>tapis-franc</i>,
her countenance expressed the disdain, the disgust,
which persons of a certain rank feel when they
come in contact with low wretches whom they take as
tools or accomplices.</p>

<p>Thomas Seyton, who, until now, had actively served
the criminal machinations of his sister, although he considered
them as all but futile, had refused any longer to
continue this contemptible part, consenting, nevertheless,
for the first and last time to put his sister in
communication with the Chouette, without himself interfering
in the fresh projects they might plan. The
countess, unable to win back Rodolph to her by breaking
the bonds or the affections which she believed so dear to
him, hoped, as we have seen, to render him the dupe of
a base deceit, the success of which might realise the
vision of this obstinate, ambitious, and cruel woman.
Her design was to persuade Rodolph that their daughter
was not dead, and to substitute an orphan for the child.</p>

<p>We know that Jacques Ferrand&mdash;having formally
refused to participate in this plot in spite of Sarah's
menaces&mdash;had resolved to make away with Fleur-de-Marie,
as much from the fear of the Chouette's disclosure,
as from fear of the obstinate persistence of the countess.
But the latter had by no means abandoned her design,
feeling persuaded that she should corrupt or intimidate
the notary when she should be assured of having obtained
a young girl capable of filling the character which
she desired her to assume.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence Sarah said to the Chouette,
"You are adroit, discreet, and resolute?"</p>

<p>"Adroit as a monkey, resolute as a bulldog, and mute
as a fish; such is the Chouette, and such the devil made
her; at your service if you want her,&mdash;and you do,"
replied the old wretch, quickly. "I hope we have
managed well with the young country wench who is now
in St. Lazare for two good months."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are not talking of her, but of something
else."</p>

<p>"Anything you please, my handsome lady, provided
there's money at the end of what you mean to propose,
and then we shall be as right as my fingers."</p>

<p>Sarah could not control a movement of disgust. "You
must know," she resumed, "many people in the lower
ranks of life,&mdash;persons who are in misfortune?"</p>

<p>"There are more of them than there are of millionaires;
you may pick and choose. We have plentiful
wretchedness in Paris."</p>

<p>"I want to meet with a poor orphan girl, and particularly
if she lost her parents young. She must be
good-looking, of gentle disposition, and not more than
seventeen years of age."</p>

<p>The Chouette gazed at Sarah with amazement.</p>

<p>"Such an orphan girl must be by no means difficult
to meet with," continued the countess; "there are so
many foundling children!"</p>

<p>"Why, my good lady, you forget La Goualeuse. She
is the very thing."</p>

<p>"Who is La Goualeuse?"</p>

<p>"The young thing we carried off from Bouqueval."</p>

<p>"We are not talking of her now, I tell you."</p>

<p>"But hear me, and be sure you pay me well for my
advice. You want an orphan girl, as quiet as a lamb,
as handsome as daylight, and who is only seventeen, you
say?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, then, take La Goualeuse when she leaves St.
Lazare; she is the very thing for you, as if we had
made her on purpose. For she was about six years of
age when that scamp, Jacques Ferrand (and it's now
ten years ago), gave her to me with a thousand francs,
in order to get rid of her,&mdash;that is to say, it was Tournemine,
who is now at the galleys at Rochefort, who
brought her to me, saying there was no doubt she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
some child they wanted to get rid of or pass off for
dead."</p>

<p>"Jacques Ferrand, do you say?" exclaimed Sarah,
in a voice so choked that the Chouette receded several
paces. "The notary, Jacques Ferrand, gave you this
child&mdash;and&mdash;?" She could not finish, her emotion
was too violent; and with her two clasped hands extended
towards the Chouette, she trembled convulsively,
surprise and joy agitating her features.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is that makes you so much in
earnest, my good lady," replied the old hag; "but it is
a very simple story. Ten years ago Tournemine, an old
pal of mine, said to me: 'Have you a mind to take
charge of a little girl that they want to get out of the
way? No matter whether she slips her wind or not.
There's a thousand francs for the job, and do what you
like with the 'kinchin.'"</p>

<p>"Ten years ago?" cried Sarah.</p>

<p>"Ten years."</p>

<p>"A little fair girl?"</p>

<p>"A little fair girl."</p>

<p>"With blue eyes?"</p>

<p>"Blue eyes&mdash;as blue as blue bells."</p>

<p>"And it was she who was at the farm?"</p>

<p>"And we packed her up and carted her off to St. Lazare.
I must say, though, that I didn't expect to find her&mdash;Pegriotte&mdash;in
the country as I did, though."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>mon Dieu!</i> <i>mon Dieu!</i>" exclaimed Sarah, falling
on her knees, and elevating her hands and eyes to
heaven, "Thy ways are inscrutable, and I bow down before
thy providence! Oh, if such happiness be possible!
But, no, I cannot yet believe it; it would be too fortunate!
No!" Then rising suddenly she said to the
Chouette, who was gazing at her with the utmost astonishment,
"Follow me!" And Sarah walked before her
with hasty steps.</p>

<p>At the end of the alley she ascended several steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
that led by a glass door to a small room sumptuously
furnished. At the moment when the Chouette was
about to enter, Sarah made a sign to her to remain
outside, and then rang the bell violently. A servant
appeared.</p>

<p>"I am not at home to anybody, and let no one enter
here,&mdash;no one, do you hear?"</p>

<p>The servant bowed and retired. Sarah, for the
sake of greater security, pushed to the bolt. The
Chouette heard the order given to the servant, and
saw Sarah fasten the bolt. The countess then turning
towards her, said: "Come in quickly, and shut the
door."</p>

<p>The Chouette did as she was bidden.</p>

<p>Hastily opening a <i>secrétaire</i>, Sarah took from it an
ebony coffer, which she placed on a writing-table in the
centre of the room, and beckoned the Chouette towards
her. The coffer was filled with small caskets lying one
upon the other, and containing splendid jewelry. Sarah
was in so much haste to arrive at the bottom of the
coffer, that she hastily scattered over the table these
jewel-cases, splendidly filled with necklaces, bracelets,
tiaras of rubies, emeralds, and diamonds, which sparkled
with a thousand fires.</p>

<p>The Chouette was dazzled. She was armed, was alone
with the countess; escape was easy&mdash;certain. An infernal
idea shot through the brain of this monster. But
to put this new crime into execution it was necessary to
extricate her stiletto from her basket, and approach
Sarah without exciting her suspicions.</p>

<p>With the craft of the tiger-cat, who grovels along
treacherously towards its prey, the beldame profited by
the countess's preoccupation to move imperceptibly around
the table which separated her from her victim. The
Chouette had already begun her perfidious movement,
when she was compelled suddenly to stop short. Sarah
took a locket from the bottom of the box, leaned over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the table, and, handing it to the Chouette with a trembling
hand, said:</p>

<p>"Look at this portrait."</p>

<p>"It is Pegriotte!" exclaimed the Chouette, struck
with the strong resemblance; "it is the little girl who
was handed to me! I think I see her just as she was
when Tournemine brought her to me. That's just like
her long curling hair, which I cut off and sold directly,
<i>ma foi!</i>"</p>

<p>"You recognise her; it is really she? Oh, I conjure
you, do not deceive me&mdash;do not deceive me!"</p>

<p>"I tell you, my good lady, it is Pegriotte, as if I saw
herself there," said the Chouette, trying to draw nearer
to Sarah without being remarked. "And even now she
is very like this portrait; if you saw her you would be
struck by the likeness."</p>

<p>Sarah had not uttered one cry of pain or alarm when
she learned that her daughter had been for ten years
leading a wretched existence, forsaken as she was. Not
one feeling of remorse was there when she reflected that
she herself had snatched her away disastrously from the
peaceful retreat in which Rodolph had placed her. This
unnatural mother did not eagerly question the Chouette
with terrible anxiety as to the past life of the child.
No! In her heart ambition had long since stifled every
sentiment of maternal tenderness. It was not joy at
again being restored to a lost daughter that transported
her,&mdash;it was the hope of seeing at length realised the
vain dream of her whole existence. Rodolph had felt
deeply interested in this unfortunate girl, had protected
her without knowing her; what would then be his feelings
when he discovered that she was&mdash;his daughter?
He was free&mdash;the countess was a widow! Sarah
already saw the sovereign crown sparkling on her
brow.</p>

<p>The Chouette, still stealing on with slow steps, had at
length reached one end of the table, and had her stiletto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
perpendicularly in her basket, its handle on a level with
the opening, and within her clutch. She was but a step
or two from the countess.</p>

<p>"Do you know how to write?" inquired Sarah of her;
and, pushing from her the casket and gems, she opened
a blotting-book, which was by an inkstand.</p>

<p>"No, madame; I do not!" replied the Chouette, at
all risks.</p>

<p>"I will write, then, at your dictation. Tell me all
the circumstances of the abandonment of this little
girl."</p>

<p>And Sarah, sitting in an armchair before the writing-table,
took up a pen, and made a sign to the Chouette to
come close to her. The old wretch's one eye sparkled.
At last she was standing up, close to the seat on which
Sarah was sitting, and, stooping over a table, was preparing
to write.</p>

<p>"I will read aloud, and then," said the countess, "you
can correct any mistakes."</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," replied the Chouette, narrowly
watching every motion of Sarah; and she furtively
introduced her hand into her basket, that she might
be able to grasp the poniard without being observed.</p>

<p>The countess commenced writing.</p>

<p>"I declare that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then interrupting herself, and turning towards the
Chouette, who was at the moment touching the handle
of her poniard, Sarah added:</p>

<p>"At what period was the child brought to you?"</p>

<p>"In the month of February, 1827."</p>

<p>"And by whom?" continued Sarah, turning towards
the Chouette.</p>

<p>"By Pierre Tournemine, now at the galleys at
Rochefort. It was Madame Séraphin, the notary's
housekeeper, who brought the young girl to him."</p>

<p>The countess continued writing, and then read
aloud:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>"I declare that, in the month of February, 1827, a
person named&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chouette had drawn the poniard; already had
she raised her arm to strike her victim between the
shoulders; Sarah turned again. The Chouette, that
she might not be off her guard, leaned her right
hand, armed as it was, on the back of Sarah's armchair,
and then stooped towards her, as if in attitude
to reply to her question.</p>

<p>"Tell me again the name of the man who handed the
child to you?" said the countess.</p>

<p>"Pierre Tournemine," repeated Sarah, as she wrote it
down, "at this time at the galleys of Rochefort, brought
me a child, which had been confided to him by the
housekeeper of&mdash;"</p>

<p>The countess could not finish. The Chouette having
got rid of her basket by allowing it to slide from her
arm onto the floor, threw herself on the countess with
equal fury and rapidity; and having grasped the back
of her neck with her left hand, forced her face down on
the table, and then with her right hand drove the
stiletto in between her two shoulders.</p>

<p>This atrocious assassination was so promptly effected
that the countess did not utter a cry&mdash;a moan. Still
sitting, she remained with her head and the front
of her body on the table. Her pen fell from her
fingers.</p>

<p>"Just the very blow which <i>fourline</i> gave the little old
man in the Rue du Roule!" said the monster. "One
more who will never wag tongue again! Her account
is settled!" And the Chouette, gathering up the jewels
together, huddled them into her basket, not perceiving
that her victim still breathed.</p>

<p>The murder and robbery effected, the horrid old
devil opened the glass door, ran swiftly along the tree-covered
path, went out by the small side door, and
reached the lone tract of ground. Near the Observatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
she took a hackney-coach, which drove her to
Bras-Rouge's in the Champs Elysées.</p>

<p>The widow Martial, Nicholas, Calabash, and Barbillon
had, as we know, an appointment with the Chouette in
this den of infamy, in order to rob and murder the
diamond-matcher.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<h5>THE AGENT OF SAFETY.</h5>


<p>The reader already knows the Bleeding Heart in the
Champs Elysées, near the Court de la Reine, in one of
the deep ditches which, a few years since, were close
to this promenade. The inhabitants of the Isle du
Ravageur had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>After the departure of Bradamanti, who had, as we
know, accompanied Madame d'Harville's stepmother
into Normandy, Tortillard had returned to his father.
Placed as a sentinel at the top of the staircase, the little
cripple was to announce the arrival of the Martials by
a certain cry, Bras-Rouge being at this moment in secret
conference with an <i>agent-de-sûreté</i> named Narcisse Borel,
whom the reader may perchance remember to have seen
at the <i>tapis-franc</i> of the ogress, when he came there to
arrest two miscreants accused of murder.</p>

<p>This agent, a man about forty years of age, was thickset
and powerful, with a high colour, a keen, quick eye,
his face entirely shaven, in order that he might better
assume the various disguises necessary for his dangerous
expeditions; for it was frequently necessary for him to
unite the transformations of the actor to the courage and
energy of the soldier, in order to seize on certain ruffians
with whom he had to contend in cunning and determination.
Narcisse Borel was, in a word, one of the most
useful and most active instruments of that providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
on a small scale which is modestly and commonly termed
the police.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>We will return to the conversation between Narcisse
Borel and Bras-Rouge, which appeared to be very animated.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the agent of safety; "you are accused of
profiting by your double-faced position, and of taking
with impunity a share in the booty of a band of most
dangerous malefactors, and then giving false information
respecting them to the protective police. Take
care, Bras-Rouge; for if you are detected no mercy will
be shown you!"</p>

<p>"Alas! I know I am accused of this; and it is very
distressing for me, my good M. Narcisse," replied Bras-Rouge,
whilst his weasel's face assumed a hypocritical
air of vexation. "But I hope that this day will at last
do me justice, and my good faith will be recognised."</p>

<p>"That remains to be proved."</p>

<p>"How can I be distrusted&mdash;have I not given proofs?
Was it I or was it not who, at the time, enabled you to
apprehend Ambroise Martial, one of the most dangerous
malefactors in Paris, in the very fact?"</p>

<p>"All this is very fine and good; but Ambroise was
warned they were going to arrest him, and if I had not
been earlier than the hour you told me of, he would have
escaped."</p>

<p>"Do you think me capable, M. Narcisse, of having
secretly told him of your coming?"</p>

<p>"I only know that I received from the scoundrel a
pistol-shot aimed full at me, but which, fortunately, only
grazed my arm."</p>

<p>"Why, to be sure, M. Narcisse, in your profession you
must be occasionally exposed to such mistakes!"</p>

<p>"Ah, you call these mistakes, eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; for, no doubt, the wicked fellow intended
to lodge the ball in your body."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the arm, body, or head, no matter, I don't complain
of that; every profession has its disagreeables."</p>

<p>"And its pleasures, too, M. Narcisse, and its pleasures.
For instance, when a man as cunning, as skilful, and
as courageous as you, has been for a long time on
the track of a gang of villains, whom he follows from
quarter to quarter, from lurking-place to lurking-place,
with a good bloodhound like your poor servant to command,
Bras-Rouge, and, finally, marks them down and
comes upon them in a trap from which not one of them
can escape, why, then, you must say, M. Narcisse, that
there is great pleasure in it,&mdash;the joy of a sportsman,&mdash;not
including the service he renders to justice!" added
the host of the Bleeding Heart, with a grave air.</p>

<p>"I should fully agree with you if the bloodhound were
faithful, but I fear it is not."</p>

<p>"Ah, M. Narcisse, you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think that, instead of putting us on the track, you
amuse yourself with setting us on a false scent, and
abuse the confidence placed in you. Every day you
promise to aid us to lay hands on the gang, and that
day never arrives."</p>

<p>"What if the day arrives to-day, M. Narcisse, as I am
sure it will? What if I bring together in a parcel Barbillon,
Nicholas Martial, the widow, her daughter, and
the Chouette? Will that or will it not be a good
sweep of the net? Will you then mistrust me any
longer?"</p>

<p>"No; and you will have rendered a real service; for
there are very strong presumptive facts against this
gang,&mdash;suspicions almost assured, but, unfortunately, no
proofs."</p>

<p>"So, then, a small fag-end of actual crime, which
would allow of their being apprehended, would help
amazingly to unravel the difficult skein,&mdash;eh, M. Narcisse?"</p>

<p>"Most decidedly. And you assure me that there has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
not been the slightest incitement on your part towards
the <i>coup</i> which they are now going to attempt?"</p>

<p>"No, on my honour! It is the Chouette, who came
to me to propose inveigling the diamond-matcher here
when that infernal hag learned from my son that Morel,
the lapidary, who lives in the Rue du Temple, was a
workman in real stones, and not in false, and that
Mother Mathieu had frequently considerable value about
her person, I acceded to the proposition, and suggested
to the Chouette that the Martials and Barbillon should
join her, so that I might be able to put the whole party
into your hands."</p>

<p>"And the Schoolmaster,&mdash;that fellow who is so dangerous,
so powerful, and so ferocious, and who was
always with the Chouette,&mdash;one of the frequenters of
the <i>tapis-franc</i>?"</p>

<p>"The Schoolmaster?" said Bras-Rouge, feigning astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, a convict escaped from the galleys at Rochefort,
Anselm Duresnel by name, sentenced for life. We
know now that he disfigured himself on purpose, that
he might not be recognised. Have you no trace of
him?"</p>

<p>"None," replied Bras-Rouge, boldly, for he had his
reasons for the lie, the Schoolmaster being at this very
moment shut up in one of the cellars of the cabaret.</p>

<p>"There is every reason to believe that the Schoolmaster
is the author of fresh murders. He would be an
important capture."</p>

<p>"No one knows what has become of him for the last
six weeks."</p>

<p>"And that's the reason you are reproached with
having lost all trace of him."</p>

<p>"Always reproaches, M. Narcisse, always!"</p>

<p>"Not for want of ample cause! And how goes on the
smuggling?"</p>

<p>"Is it not necessary that I should know something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
all kinds of persons&mdash;smugglers as well as others&mdash;in
order to put you on the scent? I disclosed to you that
pipe to introduce liquids, established outside the Barrière
du Trône, and coming into a house in the street."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Narcisse, interrupting Bras-Rouge;
"but for one that you denounce, you allow ten
to escape, and continue your traffic with impunity. I am
sure you eat at two mangers, as the saying is."</p>

<p>"Oh, M. Narcisse, I am incapable of an appetite so
dishonest!"</p>

<p>"That is not all: in the Rue du Temple, No. 17,
there lives a woman named Burette, who lends money
on deposit, who, they say, is a private receiver of stolen
goods on your account."</p>

<p>"What would you have me do, M. Narcisse? The
world is so slanderous,&mdash;says so many wicked things!
Once again, I say, it is necessary for me to mix with as
many rogues as possible, that I even seem one of themselves&mdash;so
much the worse for them&mdash;in order that
they may not have any suspicions; but it cuts me to the
heart to imitate them,&mdash;cuts me to the heart. I must,
indeed, be devoted to the service, to give myself up to
such a thing as that."</p>

<p>"Poor, dear man! I pity you with all my soul!"</p>

<p>"You are laughing at me, M. Narcisse; but, if that
was believed, why has there not been a search made at
Mother Burette's and in my house?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough,&mdash;that we might not alarm
the ruffians, whom, for so long a time, you have promised
to deliver into our hands."</p>

<p>"And I am now about to deliver them, M. Narcisse;
before an hour you will have them all handcuffed, and
that without much trouble, for there are three women.
As to Barbillon and Nicholas Martial, they are as savage
as tigers, but as cowardly as pullets."</p>

<p>"Tigers or pullets," said Narcisse, half opening his
long frock coat, and showing the butts of two pistols in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the pockets of his trousers, "I have wherewithal here for
them."</p>

<p>"You will do well to have two of your men with you,
M. Narcisse. When they see themselves caught, the
most cowardly sometimes show fight."</p>

<p>"I shall station two of my men in the small parlour
at the entrance, by the side of the room into which you
are to introduce the jewel-matcher. At the first cry, I
shall appear at one door, and my two men at the other."</p>

<p>"You must be speedy, then, for I expect the gang here
every moment, M. Narcisse."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will go at once and place my men, provided
that all this is not another humbug."</p>

<p>The conversation was cut short by the peculiar whistle
intended as a signal. Bras-Rouge looked out of a window
to see whom it was that Tortillard announced.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! It is the Chouette already. Well, do you
believe me now, M. Narcisse?"</p>

<p>"Why, this looks something like; but it is not all.
But we shall see. And now to station my men."</p>

<p>And the agent of safety disappeared at a side door.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<h5>THE CHOUETTE.</h5>


<p>The precipitation of the Chouette's step, the fierce
throbbings of a fever of rapine and murder which still
animated her, had suffused her hideous features with a
deep purple, whilst her green eye sparkled with savage
joy. Tortillard followed her, hopping and skipping. At
the moment when she descended the last steps of the
stairs, Bras-Rouge's son, from pure mischief, put his foot
on the long and dragging skirts of the Chouette's gown.
This sudden stoppage made the old woman stumble, and,
unable to catch hold of the baluster, she fell on her
knees, her two hands extended, and dropping her precious
basket, whence escaped a gold bracelet set with
emeralds and pearls. The Chouette having, in her fall,
somewhat excoriated her fingers, picked up the bracelet,
which had not escaped the keen sight of Tortillard, and,
recovering her feet, turned furiously to the little cripple,
who approached her with a hypocritical air, saying to
her:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me! Did your foot slip?"</p>

<p>Without making any reply, the Chouette seized Tortillard
by the hair, and, stooping to a level with his cheek,
she bit it with such fury that the blood spurted out beneath
her teeth. Strange, however, Tortillard, in spite
of his usual vindictiveness, in spite of feeling such intense
pain, did not utter a murmur or a cry. He only wiped his
bleeding cheek, and said, with a forced laugh:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope next time you will not kiss me so hard,&mdash;eh,
La Chouette?"</p>

<p>"Wicked little brat! Why did you tread on my gown
on purpose to make me fall?"</p>

<p>"Me? Oh! How could you think so? I swear I
didn't do it on purpose, my dear Chouette! Don't think
your little Tortillard would do you any harm; he loves
you too well for that. You should never beat him, or
scold him, or bite him, for he is as fond of you as if he
were a poor little dog, and you were his mistress!" said
the boy, in a gentle and insinuating tone.</p>

<p>Deceived by Tortillard's hypocrisy, the Chouette
believed him, and replied:</p>

<p>"Well, well, if I was wrong to bite you, why, let it go
for all the other times you have deserved it, you little
villain! But, <i>vive la joie</i>! To-day I bear no malice.
Where is your old rogue of a father?"</p>

<p>"In the house. Shall I go and find him for you?"</p>

<p>"No; are the Martials here?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Then I have time to go down and visit <i>fourline</i>. I
want to speak to old No-Eyes."</p>

<p>"Will you go into the Schoolmaster's cellar?"
inquired Tortillard, scarcely concealing his diabolical
delight.</p>

<p>"What's that to you?"</p>

<p>"To me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you ask me the question with such an odd
air."</p>

<p>"Because I was thinking of something odd."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why, that you ought, at least, to have brought him
a pack of cards to pass away his time," replied Tortillard,
with a cunning look; "that would divert him a little;
now he has nothing to play at but not to be bitten by the
rats; and he always wins at that game, and after awhile
it becomes tiresome."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chouette laughed heartily at Tortillard's wit, and
said to the cripple:</p>

<p>"Love of a baby boy to his mammy! I do not know
any chap who has more vice than this scamp. Go and
get me a candle, that you may light me down to see <i>fourline</i>,
and you can help me to open his door. You know
that I can hardly push it by myself."</p>

<p>"Well, no, it is so very dark in the cellar," said
Tortillard, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"What! What! You who are as wicked as devil
to be a coward? I like to see that, indeed! Go directly,
and tell your father that I shall be with him almost
immediately; that I am with <i>fourline</i>; and that we are
talking of putting up the banns for our marriage. He,
he, he!" added the disgusting wretch, grinning. "So
make haste, and you shall be bridesman, and, if you are
a good boy, you shall have my garter."</p>

<p>Tortillard went, with a sulky air, to fetch a light.
Whilst she was waiting for him, the Chouette, perfectly
intoxicated with the success of her robbery, put her hand
into her basket to feel the precious jewels it enclosed. It
was for the purpose of temporarily concealing this treasure
that she desired to descend into the Schoolmaster's
cellar, and not, according to her habit, to enjoy the torments
of her new victim.</p>

<p>We will presently explain why, with Bras-Rouge's
connivance, the Chouette had immured the Schoolmaster
in the very subterranean cave into which this miscreant
had formerly precipitated Rodolph.</p>

<p>Tortillard, holding a light, now appeared at the door
of the cabaret. The Chouette followed him into the lower
room, in which opened the trap with the folding-doors,
with which we are already acquainted. Bras-Rouge's
son, sheltering the light in the hollow of his hand, and
preceding the old woman, slowly descended a stone staircase,
which led to a sharp declivity, at the end of which
was the thick door of the cellar which had so nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
proved Rodolph's grave. When he reached the bottom
of the staircase, Tortillard pretended to hesitate in
following the Chouette.</p>

<p>"Well, now, you little vagabond, go on!" she said.</p>

<p>"Why, it is so dark; and you go so fast, Chouette!
And, indeed, I'd rather go back again, and leave you the
light."</p>

<p>"And then, foolish imp, how am I to open the cellar
door by myself? Will you come on?"</p>

<p>"No, I am so frightened!"</p>

<p>"If I begin with you! Mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you threaten me, I'll go back again!" and Tortillard
retreated several paces.</p>

<p>"Well, listen to me, now,&mdash;be a good boy," said
the Chouette, repressing her anger, "and I'll give you
something."</p>

<p>"Well, what?" said Tortillard, coming up to her.
"Speak to me so always, and I'll do anything you wish
me, Mother Chouette."</p>

<p>"Come, come, I'm in a hurry!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but promise me that I may have some fun
with the Schoolmaster."</p>

<p>"Another time; I haven't time to-day."</p>

<p>"Only a little bit,&mdash;just let me tease him for five
minutes?"</p>

<p>"Another time; I tell you that I want to return
up-stairs as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"Why, then, do you want to open the door of his
apartment?"</p>

<p>"That's no affair of yours. Come, now, have done
with this. Perhaps the Martials are come by this
time, and I must have some talk with them. So be
a good boy, and you sha'n't be sorry for it. Come
along."</p>

<p>"I must love you very much, Chouette, for you
make me do just what you like," said Tortillard, slowly
advancing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>The dim, wavering light of the candle, which but
imperfectly lighted this gloomy way, reflected the black
profile of this hideous brat on the slimy walls, which
were full of crevices and reeking with damp. At the
end of this passage, through the half obscurity, might
be seen the low and crumbling arch of the entrance to
the cellar, the thick door strengthened with iron bars,
and, standing out in the shade, the red shawl and white
cap of the Chouette.</p>

<p>By the united exertions of the two, the door opened
harshly on its rusty hinges; a puff of humid vapour
escaped from this den, as dark as midnight. The light,
placed on the ground, threw its faint beams on the first
steps of the stone staircase, the bottom of which was
completely lost in the darkness. A cry, or, rather, a
savage roar, came from the depths of the cave.</p>

<p>"Ah, there's <i>fourline</i> wishing his mamma good-morning!"
said the Chouette, with a sneer.</p>

<p>And she descended several steps, in order to conceal
her basket in some hole.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry!" exclaimed the Schoolmaster, in a
voice that shook with rage; "do you wish to kill me
like a mad dog?"</p>

<p>"What's the deary lovey hungry?" said the Chouette,
with a laugh of mockery; "then smell its
thumb."</p>

<p>There was a sound like that of a chain twisted violently;
then a groan of mute, repressed passion.</p>

<p>"Take care! Take care, or you'll have a bump in
your leg, as you had at Bouqueval farm, poor dear pa!"
said Tortillard.</p>

<p>"He's right, the boy is,&mdash;keep yourself quiet, <i>fourline</i>,"
continued the hag; "the ring and chain are solid,
old No-Eyes, for they came from Father Micou's, and he
sells nothing but the best goods. It is your fault, too;
why did you allow yourself to be bound whilst you were
asleep? We only had then to put the ring and chain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
this place, and bring you down here in the cool to preserve
you, old darling."</p>

<p>"That's a pity! He'll grow mouldy," said Tortillard.</p>

<p>Again the clank of the chain was heard.</p>

<p>"He, he, <i>fourline</i>! Why, he's dancing like a cockchafer
tied by the claw," said the beldame, "I think I
see him!"</p>

<p>"Cockchafer, cockchafer, fly away home! Fly, fly,
fly! Your husband is the Schoolmaster!" sung Tortillard.</p>

<p>This increased the Chouette's hilarity. Having deposited
her basket in a hole formed by the lowering of
the wall of the staircase, she stood erect, and said:</p>

<p>"You see, <i>fourline</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He don't see," said Tortillard.</p>

<p>"The brat's right. Will you hear, <i>fourline</i>? There
was no occasion, when we came away from the farm, to
be such a booby as to turn compassionate, and prevent
me from marking Pegriotte's face with my vitriol; and
then, too, you talked of your conscience, which was getting
troubled. I saw you were growing lily-livered, and
meant to come the 'honest dodge;' and so, some of these
odd-come-shortlies, you would have turned 'nose' (informer),
and have 'made a meal' of us, old No-Eyes;
and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then old No-Eyes will make a meal of you, for he
is hungry, Chouette," said Tortillard, suddenly, and with
all his strength pushing the old woman by her back.</p>

<p>The Chouette fell forward with a horrible imprecation.
She might have been distinctly heard as she rolled from
the top to the bottom of the staircase.</p>

<p>"Bump, bump, bump, bump! There's the Chouette
for you&mdash;there she is! Why don't you jump upon her,
old buffer?" added Tortillard.</p>

<p>Then, seizing the basket from under the stone where
he had seen the old woman place it, he scampered up the
stairs, exclaiming, with a shout of savage joy:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here's a pull worth more than that you had before,&mdash;eh,
Chouette? This time you won't bite me till the
blood comes,&mdash;eh? Ah, you thought I bore no spite&mdash;much
obliged&mdash;my cheek bleeds still!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have her! I have her!" cried the Schoolmaster,
from the depth of the cave.</p>

<p>"If you have her, old lad, I cry snacks," said Tortillard,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>And he stopped on the top step of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Help!" shrieked the Chouette, in a strangling
voice.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Tortillard!" said the Schoolmaster, "thanks.
And, to reward you, you shall hear the night-bird
(Chouette) shriek! Listen, boy,&mdash;listen to the bird of
death!"</p>

<p>"Bravo! Here I am in the dress-boxes!" said Tortillard,
seating himself on the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>As he said this, he raised the light to endeavour to
see the fearful scene which was going on in the depths
of the cavern; but the darkness was too thick, so faint
a light could not disperse it: Bras-Rouge's son could not
see anything. The struggle with the Schoolmaster and
the Chouette was mute, deadly, without a word, without
a cry; only from time to time was heard the hard
breathing, or the stifled groan, which always accompanies
violent and desperate efforts. Tortillard, seated on
the step, began to stamp his feet with that cadence
peculiar to an audience impatient to see the beginning
of a play; then he uttered the cry so familiar to the
frequenters of the gallery of the minor theatres:</p>

<p>"Music! Music! Play up! Up with the curtain!"</p>

<p>"Oh, now I have hold of you, as I desired," murmured
the Schoolmaster, from the recess of the cellar;
"and you were going&mdash;"</p>

<p>A desperate movement of the Chouette interrupted
him; she struggled with all the energy which the fear
of death inspires.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>"Louder! Can't hear!" bawled Tortillard.</p>

<p>"It is in vain you try to gnaw my hand, I will hold
you as I like," said the Schoolmaster. Then, having,
no doubt, succeeded in keeping the Chouette down, he
added, "That's it! Now listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tortillard, call your father!" shrieked the Chouette,
with a faltering, exhausted voice. "Help! Help!"</p>

<p>"Turn her out, the old thing! She won't let us
hear," said the little cripple, with a shout of laughter;
"put her out!"</p>

<p>The Chouette's cries were not audible from this cavern,
low as it was. The wretched creature, seeing that
there was no chance of help from Bras-Rouge's son,
resolved to try a last effort.</p>

<p>"Tortillard, go and fetch help, and I will give you
my basket; it is full of jewels. There it is, under
a stone."</p>

<p>"How generous! Thank ye, madame. Why, haven't
I got it already? Hark! Don't you hear how it
rattles?" said Tortillard, shaking it. "But now, if
you'll give us half a pound of gingerbread nuts, I'll
go and fetch pa."</p>

<p>"Have pity on me, and I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chouette was unable to conclude. Again there
was a profound silence. The little cripple again began
to beat time on the stone staircase on which he was
seated, accompanying the noise of his feet with the
repeated cry:</p>

<p>"Why don't you begin? Up with the curtain!
Music! Music!"</p>

<p>"In this way, Chouette, you can no longer disturb
me with your cries," said the Schoolmaster, after a few
minutes, during which he had, no doubt, gagged the
old woman. "You know very well," he continued, in
a slow, hollow voice, "that I do not wish to end this all
at once; torture for torture! You have made me suffer
enough, and I must speak at length to you before I kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
you,&mdash;yes, at length. It will be very terrible for you,
agonising!"</p>

<p>"Come, no stuff and nonsense, old parson," said Tortillard,
raising himself half up from his seat; "punish her, but
don't do her any harm. You say you'll kill her,&mdash;that's
only a hum; I am very fond of my Chouette; I have
only lent her to you, and you must give her back again.
Don't spoil her,&mdash;I won't have my Chouette spoiled,&mdash;if
you do, I'll go and fetch pa!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, and she shall only have what she deserves,
a profitable lesson," said the Schoolmaster, in order to
assure Tortillard, and for fear the cripple should go and
fetch assistance.</p>

<p>"All right! Bravo! Now the play's going to begin!"
said Bras-Rouge's son, who did not seriously believe that
the Schoolmaster intended to kill the Chouette.</p>

<p>"Let us discourse a little, Chouette," continued the
Schoolmaster, in a calm voice. "In the first place, you
see, since that dream at the Bouqueval farm, which
brought all my crimes before my eyes, since that
dream, which did all but drive me mad,&mdash;which will
drive me mad, for, in my solitude, in the deep isolation
in which I live, all my thoughts dwell on this
dream, in spite of myself,&mdash;a strange change has come
over me; yes, I have a horror of my past ferocity. In
the first place, I would not allow you to make a martyr
of La Goualeuse, though that was nothing. Chaining
me here in the cellar, making me suffer from cold and
hunger, and detaining me for your wicked suggestions,
you have left me to all the fear of my own reflections.
Oh, you do not know what it is to be left alone,&mdash;always
alone,&mdash;with a dark veil over your eyes, as the pitiless
man said who punished me. Oh, it is horrid! It was
in this very cavern that I flung him, in order to kill him;
and this cavern is the place of my punishment, it may
be my grave. I repeat that this is horrid! All that
that man predicted to me has come to pass; he said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
me, 'You have abused your strength,&mdash;you will be the
plaything, the sport of the most weak.' And it has
been so. He said to me, 'Henceforward separated from
the exterior world, face to face with the eternal remembrance
of your crimes, one day you will repent those
crimes.' And that day has come; the loneliness has
purified me; I could not have believed it possible.
Another proof that I am perhaps less wicked than
formerly, is that I feel inexpressible joy in holding
you here, monster! Not to avenge myself, but to
avenge your victims,&mdash;yes, I shall have accomplished a
duty when, with my own hands, I shall have punished
my accomplice. A voice says to me, that, if
you had fallen into my power earlier, much blood, much
blood would have been spared. I have now a horror of
my past murders; and yet, is it not strange? It is without
fear, it is even with security, that I am now about to
perpetrate on you a fearful murder, with most fearful
refinements. Say, say! Do you understand that?"</p>

<p>"Bravo! Well played, old No-Eyes! He gets on,"
exclaimed Tortillard, applauding. "It is really something
to laugh at."</p>

<p>"To laugh at?" continued the Schoolmaster, in a
hollow voice. "Keep still, Chouette; I must complete
my explanation as to how I gradually came to repentance.
This revelation will be hateful to you, heart of
stone, and will prove to you also how remorseless
I ought to be in the vengeance which I should wreak on
you in the name of our victims. I must be quick. My
delight at grasping you thus makes my blood throb in
my veins,&mdash;my temples beat with violence, just as when,
by thinking of my dream, my reason wanders. Perhaps
one of my crises will come on; but I shall have time
to make the approaches of death frightful to you by
compelling you to hear me."</p>

<p>"At him, Chouette!" cried Tortillard. "At him!
And reply boldly! Why, you don't know your part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Tell the 'old one' to prompt you, my worthy elderly
damsel."</p>

<p>"It is useless for you to struggle and bite me," said
the Schoolmaster, after another pause. "You shall not
escape me,&mdash;you have bitten my fingers to the bone;
but I will pull your tongue out, if you stir. Let us continue
our discourse. When I have been alone&mdash;alone
in the night and silence&mdash;I have begun to experience
fits of furious, impotent rage; and, for the first time,
my senses wandered. Oh! though I was awake, I
again dreamed the dream&mdash;you know&mdash;the dream.
The little old man in the Rue du Roule, the drowned
woman, the cattle-dealer, and you&mdash;soaring over these
phantoms! I tell you it was horrible! I am blind,
and my thoughts assume a form, a body, in order to
represent to me incessantly, and in a visible, palpable
manner, the features of my victims. I should not have
dreamed this fearful vision, had not my mind, continually
absorbed by the remembrance of my past crimes,
been troubled with the same fantasies. Unquestionably,
when one is deprived of sight, the ideas that beset us
form themselves into images in the brain. Yet sometimes,
by dint of viewing them with resigned terror, it
would appear that these menacing spectres have pity on
me,&mdash;they grow dim&mdash;fade away&mdash;vanish. Then I
feel myself awakened from my horrid dream, but so
weak&mdash;cast down&mdash;prostrated&mdash;that&mdash;would you
believe it? ah, how you will laugh, Chouette!&mdash;that
I weep! Do you hear? I weep! You don't laugh?
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh, I say!"</p>

<p>The Chouette gave a dull and stifled groan.</p>

<p>"Louder," said Tortillard; "can't hear."</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the Schoolmaster, "I weep, for I
suffer and rage in vain. I say to myself, 'To-morrow,
next day, for ever, I shall be a prey to the same attacks
of delirium and gloomy desolation. 'What a life! Oh,
what a life! And I would not choose death rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
than be buried alive in this abyss which incessantly
pervades my thoughts! Blind, alone, and a prisoner,&mdash;what
can relieve me from my remorse? Nothing, nothing!
When the fantasies disappear for a moment,
and do not pass and repass the black veil constantly
before my eyes, there are other tortures,&mdash;other overwhelming
reflections. I say to myself, 'If I had
remained an honest man, I should be at this moment
free, tranquil, happy, beloved, and honoured by my connections,
instead of being blind and chained in this
dungeon at the mercy of my accomplices.' Alas! the
regret of happiness lost from crime is the first step
towards repentance; and when to repentance is joined
an expiation of fearful severity,&mdash;an expiation which
changes life into a long, sleepless night, filled with
avenging hallucinations or despairing reflections,&mdash;perhaps
then man's pardon succeeds to remorse and expiation."</p>

<p>"I say, old chap," exclaimed Tortillard, "you are
borrowing a bit from M. Moissard's part! Come, no
cribbing&mdash;gammon!"</p>

<p>The Schoolmaster did not hear Bras-Rouge's son.</p>

<p>"You are astonished to hear me speak thus, Chouette?
If I had continued to imbrue myself either in bloody
crimes or the fierce drunkenness of the life of the galleys,
this salutary change would never have come over
me I know full well. But alone, blind, stung with
remorse, which eats into me, of what else could I think?
Of new crimes,&mdash;how to commit them? Escape,&mdash;how
to escape? And, if I escaped, whither should I
go? What should I do with my liberty? No; I must
henceforth live in eternal night, between the anguish of
repentance and the fear of formidable apparitions which
pursue me. Sometimes, however, a faint ray of hope
comes to lighten the depth of my darkness, a moment of
calm succeeds to my torments,&mdash;yes, for sometimes I
am able to drive away the spectres which beset me by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
opposing to them the recollections of an honest and
peaceable past, by ascending in thought to my youthful
days, to my hours of infancy. Happily, the greatest
wretches have, at least, some years of peace and innocence
to oppose to their criminal and blood-stained
years. None are born wicked; the most infamous have
had the lovely candour of infancy,&mdash;have tasted the
sweet joys of that delightful age. And thus, I again
say, I sometimes find a bitter consolation in saying to
myself, 'I am, at this hour, doomed to universal execration,
but there was a time when I was beloved, protected,
because I was inoffensive and good. Alas! I must,
indeed, take refuge in the past, when I can, for it is
there only that I can find calm.'"</p>

<p>As he uttered these last words, the tones of the
Schoolmaster lost their harshness; this man of iron
appeared deeply moved, and he added:</p>

<p>"But now the salutary influence of these thoughts is
such that my fury is appeased; courage, power will fail
me to punish you. No, it is not I who will shed your
blood."</p>

<p>"Well said, old buck! So, you see, Chouette, it was
only a lark," cried Tortillard, applauding.</p>

<p>"No, it is not I who will shed your blood," continued
the Schoolmaster; "it would be a murder, excusable
perhaps, but still a murder; and I have enough with
three spectres; and then&mdash;who knows?&mdash;perhaps one
day you will repent also?"</p>

<p>And, as he spake thus, the Schoolmaster had mechanically
given the Chouette some liberty of movement.
She took advantage of it to seize the stiletto which she
had thrust into her stays after Sarah's murder, and
aimed a violent blow with this weapon at the ruffian, in
order to disengage herself from him. He uttered a cry
of extreme pain.</p>

<p>The ferocity of his hatred, his vengeance, his rage,
his bloody instincts, suddenly aroused and exasperated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
by this attack, now all burst forth suddenly, terribly,
and carried with it his reason, already so strongly shaken
by so many shocks.</p>

<p>"Ah, viper, I feel your teeth!" he exclaimed in a
voice that shook with passion, and seizing, with all his
might, the Chouette, who had thought thus to escape
him. "You are in this dungeon, then?" he added,
with an air of madness. "But I will crush the viper
or screech-owl. No doubt you were waiting for the
coming of the phantoms. Yes; for the blood beats in
my temples,&mdash;? my ears ring,&mdash;my head turns&mdash;as
when they are about to appear! Yes; I was not
deceived; here they are,&mdash;they advance from the
depths of darkness,&mdash;they advance! How pale they
are; and their blood, how it flows,&mdash;red and smoking!
It frightens you,&mdash;you struggle. Well, be still, you
shall not see the phantoms,&mdash;no, you shall not see
them. I have pity on you; I will make you blind.
You shall be, like me,&mdash;eyeless!"</p>

<p>Here the Schoolmaster paused. The Chouette uttered
a cry so horrible that Tortillard, alarmed, bounded off
the step, and stood up. The horrid shrieks of the
Chouette served to place the copestone on the fury of
the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Sing," he said, in a low voice, "sing, Chouette,&mdash;night-bird!
Sing your song of death! You are happy;
you do not see three phantoms of those we have assassinated,&mdash;the
little old man in the Rue du Roule, the
drowned woman, the cattle-dealer. I see them; they
approach; they touch me. Ah, so cold,&mdash;so cold!
Ah!"</p>

<p>The last gleam of sense of this unhappy wretch was
lost in this cry of condemnation. He could no longer
reason, but acted and roared like a wild beast, and only
obeyed the savage instinct of destruction for destruction.
A hurried trampling was now heard, interrupted
frequently at intervals with a heavy sound, which appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
like a box of bones bounding against a stone,
upon which it was intended to be broken. Sharp,
convulsive shrieks, and a burst of hellish laughter
accompanied each of these blows. Then there was
a gasp of agony. Then&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>Suddenly a distant noise of steps and voices reached
the depths of the subterranean vault. Tortillard, frozen
with terror by the fearful scene at which he had been
present without seeing it, perceived several persons holding
lights, who descended the staircase rapidly. In a
moment the cave was full of agents of safety, led by
Narcisse Borel. The Municipal Guards followed. Tortillard
was seized on the first steps of the cellar, with
the Chouette's basket still in his hand.</p>

<p>Narcisse Borel, with some of his men, descended into
the Schoolmaster's cavern. They all paused, struck by
the appalling sight. Chained by the leg to an enormous
stone placed in the middle of the cave, the Schoolmaster,
with his hair on end, his long beard, foaming mouth,
was moving like a wild beast about his den, drawing after
him by the two legs the dead carcase of the Chouette,
whose head was horribly fractured. It required desperate
exertions to snatch her from his grasp and manacle
him. After a determined resistance they at length conveyed
him into the low parlour of the cabaret, a large
dark room, lighted by a solitary window. There, handcuffed
and guarded, were Barbillon, Nicholas Martial, his
mother and sister. They had been apprehended at the
very moment when laying violent hands on the jewel-matcher
to cut her throat. She was recovering herself
in another room. Stretched on the ground, and
hardly restrained by two men, the Schoolmaster, slightly
wounded, but quite deranged, was roaring like a wild bull.</p>

<p>Barbillon, with his head hanging down, his face
ghastly, lead-coloured, his lips colourless, eye fixed
and savage, his long and straight hair falling on
the collar of his blouse, torn in the struggle, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
seated on a bench, his wrists, enclosed in handcuffs,
resting on his knees. The juvenile appearance of this
fellow (he was scarcely eighteen years of age), the regularity
of his beardless features, already emaciated and
withered, were rendered still more deplorable by the
hideous stamp which debauchery and crime had imprinted
on his physiognomy. Impassive, he did not
say a word. It could not be determined whether this
apparent insensibility was owing to stupor or to a calm
energy; his breathing was rapid, and, at times, he wiped
away the perspiration from his pale brow with his
fettered hands.</p>

<p>By his side was Calabash, whose cap had been torn
off, and her yellowish hair, tied behind with a piece of
tape, hung down in several scanty and tangled meshes.
More savage than subdued, her thin and bilious cheeks
were somewhat suffused, as she looked disdainfully at
her brother, Nicholas, who was in a chair in front of her.
Anticipating the fate that awaited him, this scoundrel
was dejected. With drooping head and trembling knees
he was overcome with fright; his teeth chattered convulsively,
and he heaved heavy groans.</p>

<p>The Mother Martial, the only one unmoved, exhibited
every proof that she had lost nothing of her accustomed
audacity. With head erect, she looked unshrinkingly
around her. However, at the sight of Bras-Rouge,&mdash;whom
they brought into the low room, after having
made him accompany the commissary and his clerk in
the minute search they had made all over the place,&mdash;the
widow's features contracted, in spite of herself, and
her small and usually dull eyes lighted up like those
of an infuriated viper; her pinched-up lips became
livid, and she twisted her manacled arms. Then, as if
sorry she had made this mute display of impotent rage,
she subdued her emotion, and became cold and calm
again.</p>

<p>Whilst the commissary and his clerk were writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
their depositions, Narcisse Borel, rubbing his hands, cast
a satisfied look on the important capture he had made,
and which freed Paris from a band of dangerous criminals;
but, confessing to himself how useful Bras-Rouge
had really been in the affair, he could not help casting
on him an expressive and grateful look.</p>

<p>Tortillard's father was to share until after trial
the confinement and lot of those he had informed
against, and, like them, he was handcuffed; and even
more than them did he assume a trembling air of consternation,
twisting his weasel's features with all his
might, in order to give them a despairing expression,
and heaving tremendous sighs. He embraced Tortillard,
as if he should find some consolation in his paternal
caresses.</p>

<p>The little cripple did not seem much moved by these
marks of tenderness; he had just learned that, for a
time, he would be moved off to the prison for young
offenders.</p>

<p>"What a misery to have a dear child!" cried Bras-Rouge,
pretending to be greatly affected. "It is we
two who are most unfortunate, madame, for we shall be
separated from our children."</p>

<p>The widow could no longer preserve her calmness;
and having no doubt of Bras-Rouge's treachery, which
she had foretold, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I was sure it was you who had sold my son at
Toulon. There, Judas!" and she spat in his face.
"You sell our heads! Well, they shall see the right
sort of deaths,&mdash;deaths of true Martials!"</p>

<p>"Yes; we shan't shrink before the carline (guillotine),"
added Calabash, with savage excitement.</p>

<p>The widow, glancing towards Nicholas, said to her
daughter, with an air of unutterable contempt:</p>

<p>"That coward there will dishonour us on the scaffold!"</p>

<p>Some minutes afterwards the widow and Calabash,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
accompanied by two policemen, got into a hackney-coach
to go to St. Lazare; Barbillon, Nicholas, and
Bras Rouge were conveyed to La Force, whilst the
Schoolmaster was conveyed to the Conciergerie, where
there are cells for the reception of lunatics.</p>
